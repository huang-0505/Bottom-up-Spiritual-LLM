                   important gospel principles being taught. Look
                   for contrasts in single verses, scripture blocks, or
                   chapters. Examples: 2 Nephi 2:27; Alma 47–48.
                   Scripture Lists. Finding lists within the scriptures
                   can help you better understand what the Lord and
                   His prophets are teaching. When you find lists, you
                   may want to number each element. Example: The
                   list of wicked practices among the Nephites found in
                   Helaman 4:11–13.
                   Scripture Symbolism. Words such as like, as, or
                   likened unto help identify symbols. Try to determine
                   what the symbol stands for. Use the footnotes, Bible
                   Dictionary, and Topical Guide to help find the symbol’s
                   meaning. Example: Compare Jacob 5:3, 75–77 with
                   Jacob 6:1–7.

                    telling us that many prophets preached and warned the
                    people about what would happen if they didn’t repent
                    (see 1 Nephi 1:4). Read 1 Nephi 1:5–7, and mark in your
                    scriptures how Lehi prayed and what he prayed about.
                    Lehi’s prayer to the Lord shows that he believed what
                    the prophets were saying.

                    One reason Satan encourages murmuring is to prevent               3. Respond to the following question in your scripture
                    people from following living prophets, inspired leaders,          study journal: What can you do if you find yourself
                    and parents. Elder H. Ross Workman of the Seventy          murmuring (complaining) about a commandment or Church
                    spoke about murmuring. He said that “murmuring             standard?
                    consists of three steps, each leading to the next in a
                    descending path to disobedience.”                          1 Nephi 2:16–19
                                 First, when people murmur, they use their     Nephi seeks understanding from the Lord
                                 own judgment and begin to question the        Read 1 Nephi 2:16, 19, and mark what Nephi wanted
                                 teachings of the living prophets. “They       and what he did that led him to accept the Lord’s
                                 [question] first in their own minds and       commandments given through his father. Although
                                 then [plant] questions in the minds of        Nephi did not murmur, ponder how what he wrote
                                 others.”                                      in 1 Nephi 2:16 about the Lord softening his heart
                    Second, those who murmur begin “to rationalize and         hints that leaving Jerusalem may have been difficult
                    excuse themselves from doing what they [have] been         for him too.
                    instructed to do. . . . Thus, they [make] an excuse for
                    disobedience.                                                     4. In your scripture study journal, share an example of a

                    “The third step inevitably follows: slothfulness in        and experienced a softening of your heart through the Spirit or of
                    following the commandment of the Master [see D&C           a time when you received a testimony of something the Lord said.

                    “I invite you to focus on the commandment from             principle: When we call upon God, He can soften
                    living prophets that bothers you the most. Do you          our hearts to believe His words.
                    question whether the commandment is applicable
                    to you? Do you find ready excuses why you cannot           Read 1 Nephi 2:17–18, and identify Nephi’s desires
                    now comply with the commandment? Do you feel               and actions after the Lord softened his heart. Think
                    frustrated or irritated with those who remind you of       about what you can learn from the different reactions
                    the commandment? Are you slothful in keeping it?           of Nephi, Sam, Laman, and Lemuel. The following is
                    Beware of the deception of the adversary. Beware of        one important truth: When we share what we have
                    murmuring” (“Beware of Murmuring,” Ensign, Nov.            learned through the Holy Spirit, others may believe
                    2001, 85–86).                                              our words.

                    would provide a way to accomplish what He required.
                    Despite repeated difficulties, Nephi faithfully persisted            • Who was Nephi speaking to?
                    in doing what the Lord had asked. As a result, he
                    was led by the Holy Spirit and successfully obtained                 • What did Nephi commit to do?
                    the plates. Nephi’s experience shows that persistent

                    situations.

                                                                                         he was commanded to make two sets of records—

                    journey through mortality—our wilderness. Remember                   plates of Nephi. The small plates were to contain
                    that the brass plates were obtained through faith and                the sacred history of his people—the ministry of the

           Lord commanded him to make. In the margin of your
           scriptures by 1 Nephi 9, write a note like the following
           to help you remember which set of plates Nephi was
           referring to: “these plates” = small plates (sacred); “other
           plates” = large plates (secular).
           As you study the Book of Mormon you will come to
           understand why Nephi kept two sets of records. Nephi
           was inspired to make an abridgement, a shortened
           version, of his father’s account (found in 1 Nephi
           1–8) on the small plates. Nearly 1,000 years later the
           prophet Mormon was directed by the Lord to include
           the small plates of Nephi with the gold plates (see
           Words of Mormon 1:7). Both men did not know why
           they were to do what they did (see 1 Nephi 9:5), but                 Nephi and his brothers talking to Ishmael’s family
           they followed the Lord’s command.
                                                                                1 Nephi 7:1–5
                   6. As you read 1 Nephi 9 in your personal study, reflect     The Lord commands Lehi’s sons to return to Jerusalem for
                   upon and record in your scripture study journal why it is    Ishmael and his family
           important to obey the Lord even when we don’t fully understand
                                                                                Think about your family, and ponder why families are
           His reasons.
                                                                                important in God’s plan.
                    7. Write the following at the bottom of today’s
                    assignments in your scripture study journal:                Read 1 Nephi 7:1–2, and find out what the Lord

           Introduction
           In 1 Nephi 8 we read about Lehi’s vision of the tree of
           life. He felt great joy as he partook of the fruit of the
           tree, which symbolizes the blessings of the Atonement.
           He then saw various groups of people who responded
           differently to the tree and its fruit. To help you prepare
           for this lesson, you may want to sing or read the words
           to “The Iron Rod” (Hymns, no. 274). As you study this

           Read 1 Nephi 15:8, and underline the question Nephi
           asked his brothers. Why is this a logical question for               Read 1 Nephi 15:14, and mark what scattered Israel

           word for in this verse means because. In other words,                they were grafted “into the true olive-tree” (1 Nephi
           Nephi’s brothers explained, “We haven’t asked the                    15:16). He also said that, like the scattering of the

           understand what is required of us in order to be taught and
           guided by the Lord?
           b. How have your efforts to learn spiritual truths and seek the
           Lord’s guidance affected your ability to feel the Spirit and
           understand the gospel?

           Nephi explains the scattering and gathering of Israel
           Nephi’s brothers were confused about Lehi’s prophecy
           and teachings of the olive tree and the Gentiles (see
           1 Nephi 15:7; see also 1 Nephi 10:12–15). Nephi
           explained that the scattering of the natural branches
           of the olive tree symbolized the physical and spiritual
           scattering of the house of Israel (God’s covenant
           people) because of their disobedience. In their
           scattered state they lost the knowledge of the gospel,

                    family when they kept the commandments. Look for
                    additional evidence of the truth of this principle as you
                    continue to study Nephi’s experience.

                             1. Take time to meaningfully answer the following
                             questions in your scripture study journal. This exercise
                    will help you see that Nephi continued to live the principle he
                    stated in 1 Nephi 17:3, while other family members failed to
                    live it. Remember to think about how this principle applies to
                    your own life.
                    a. What did the Lord command Nephi to do? (See 1 Nephi
                    17:7–8.) What may have been difficult about obeying this
                    commandment?
                    b. What impresses you about Nephi’s response to this
                    commandment? (See 1 Nephi 17:9–11, 15–16). How did his
                    brothers respond? (See 1 Nephi 17:17–21.) What can you learn
                    from these responses.
                    c. Nephi replied to his brothers by recalling the experience of
                    Moses. How did the Lord help Moses accomplish the task he was
                    commanded to do? (See 1 Nephi 17:23–29.) How were Nephi’s
                    brothers like the children of Israel? (See 1 Nephi 17:30, 42.)
                    d. Are there some commandments that are difficult for you?
                    How can you respond to difficult tasks or commandments from
                    God as Nephi and Moses did?
                    When you have finished the assignment above, read
                    Nephi’s expression of faith in 1 Nephi 17:50.
                    Read 1 Nephi 17:51, and apply this verse to yourself by
                    adding your name after the word “me” and replacing
                    the phrase “build a ship” with a commandment you
                    noted in question d above.

                    1 Nephi 19
                    Nephi records prophecies concerning Jesus Christ to
                    persuade us to remember Him
                    After arriving in the promised land, Nephi prophesied
                    concerning the coming of the Savior and how He
                    would be received by His people. Read 1 Nephi 19:8–
                    10, and identify phrases that teach about the nature
                    and character of Jesus Christ.

                              5. Record in your scripture study journal how what you
                              learned in 1 Nephi 19:8–10 increases your love for the
                    Savior.
                    Conclude today’s lesson by reading 1 Nephi 19:18–19,
                    23 and underlining what Nephi desired to persuade
                    his people and all those who read the Book of Mormon
                    to do. Look for an opportunity today to share your
                    testimony of the Savior with a friend or family member,
                    or bear your testimony in a Church setting. In doing so,
                    you might help them remember and believe in their
                    Redeemer.

                              6. Record in your scripture study journal ways in which
                              you could follow Nephi’s example in your own life.
                              7. Write the following at the bottom of today’s

                    his predicament? Not by any exertions on his part,
                    for there is no means of escape in the pit. He calls for

                    so that we can be delivered from death and hell?                  the Fall.
                    b. For whom did the Savior suffer, according to 2 Nephi 9:21?     In addition to this message of hope, Jacob taught that
                    Think about how many people “belong to the family                 the Savior’s suffering can also deliver us from the
                    of Adam” (2 Nephi 9:21). This includes all those who              spiritual death caused by our own sins. Read 2 Nephi

           go away” in 2 Nephi 9:16. Because of the Atonement,
           all mankind will return to the presence of God to be
           judged. However, if we have not repented of our sins,
           we will again be separated from God’s presence. While
           deliverance from the Fall is a gift to all mankind, our
           deliverance from the consequences of our personal sins
           depends on our desires and actions. Read 2 Nephi 9:21,
           23–24. Because of the Atonement, what can we do to be
           saved from the eternal consequences of our sins?

           Ponder the following truth: Because of Jesus Christ,
           we can be saved by grace after all we can do. Think
           of a time when you did all you could do and were
           blessed with divine help and strength.

           questions in your scripture study journal:
           a. In what ways do you worship or revere Jesus Christ? What
           activities show others that you believe in and worship Jesus Christ?

                    exercise faith in Him? (See 2 Nephi 26:13.)                           standards, and other people.
                    b. How have you witnessed or experienced some of these
                    manifestations of Jesus Christ?                                                4. Read 2 Nephi 26:29–31. In your scripture study
                    In 2 Nephi 26:14–19, Nephi prophesied that in the                              journal, list two or three characteristics of priestcrafts
                    latter days, after his people and the seed of his brothers            listed in verse 29, and then answer the following questions:
                    are weakened by unbelief, the Book of Mormon would                    a. Why do you think priestcrafts are damaging to the Church?
                    come forth. In 2 Nephi 26:20–22, he described how                     b. According to 2 Nephi 26:30, how are priestcrafts prevented?
                    many people in the latter days will be full of pride,
                    reject the miracles of God, and rely on their own
                    wisdom and learning. In what ways have you seen
                    examples of Nephi’s prophecy being fulfilled?
                    Nephi warned us that the devil uses pride, greed, and
                    secret works to ruin or destroy us. In your scriptures
                    by 2 Nephi 26:22, mark how Satan seeks to bind us.
                    A flaxen cord is a thin linen thread that can easily be
                    broken. However, when multiple threads are woven
                    together they become a strong cord. Read 2 Nephi
                    26:32, and notice the examples of “works of darkness”
                    that the Lord commands us to avoid. Ponder how a
                    single strand of thread can become the “strong cords”
                    in 2 Nephi 26:32.

                            2. Imagine you are teaching a friend how to avoid the
                            traps of the devil (Satan). Using 2 Nephi 26:20–22, 32,
                    write a paragraph in your scripture study journal that explains the
                    process by which the devil seeks to bind us. Specifically notice in
                    2 Nephi 26:22 how the adversary uses flaxen cords until his victim    2 Nephi 27:1–23
                    is bound with stronger cords, and give an example.
                                                                                          Nephi prophesies of the coming forth of the Book of
                    Nephi saw the destruction caused by the adversary and                 Mormon
                    warned of Satan’s traps and influences in the last days.
                    In contrast to Satan’s works of darkness, Nephi taught                       5. Answer the following question in your scripture study

           Satan uses these subtle tactics to persuade us to think,

           look for additional warnings.
           The Lord gave another warning and blessing, which
           is included near the end of this chapter. Read 2 Nephi

           Why does God call some people blessed? How will
           hearkening to God’s counsel help us overcome the

                    By studying the book of Jacob, you can learn               After Nephi’s death, the Nephites began to “indulge
                    important lessons from a man who had unshakable            themselves somewhat in wicked practices” under
                    faith in Jesus Christ. Jacob repeatedly testified of the   the reign of a new king (Jacob 1:15). Nephi’s two

                    the Lord. He warned his people against the dangers         people to repent and come unto Christ. Jacob obeyed
                    of pride, riches, and immorality. Jacob also quoted        Nephi’s commandment to record sacred teachings,
                    and commented on Zenos’s allegory of the olive             revelations, and prophecies on the small plates. True
                    trees, which illustrates the Savior’s tireless efforts     to his divinely given responsibility, Jacob called his

                    demonstrated how to righteously respond to those           taught about the dangers and consequences of these

                    Jacob, the fifth son of Sariah and Lehi, wrote this
                    book. He was born in the wilderness during his
                                                                               Jacob warns the people of their wickedness
                    family’s journey to the promised land. In his youth,       Consider what you would say in the following
                    Jacob “suffered afflictions and much sorrow,               situation: One of your friends at Church expresses a
                    because of the rudeness of [his] brethren” (2 Nephi        negative attitude toward his or her priesthood leaders
                    2:1). However, Lehi promised him that God would            and says, “They don’t seem to be in touch with the real

                    that he would spend his days “in the service of [his]      a big deal. I wish they wouldn’t spend so much time
                    God” (2 Nephi 2:2–3). In his youth, Jacob beheld the       telling us all the bad things we need to avoid. They

                    Jacob to be a priest and teacher of the Nephites
                    (see 2 Nephi 5:26) and later entrusted him with
                    the small plates of Nephi (see Jacob 1:1–4). As a
                    faithful priesthood leader and teacher, Jacob labored
                    diligently to persuade his people to believe in Christ
                    (see Jacob 1:7). He received revelations concerning
                    the Savior, experienced the ministering of angels
                    and heard the voice of the Lord (see Jacob 7:5), and
                    saw his Redeemer (see 2 Nephi 11:2–3). Jacob was
                    the father of Enos, to whom he entrusted the plates
                    before his death.

                    When and Where Was It Written?
                    The book of Jacob begins in approximately 544 B.C.,
                    when Nephi entrusted Jacob with the small plates.
                    It concludes near the end of Jacob’s life, when he         Think about why priesthood leaders sometimes warn
                    passed the plates to his son, Enos. Jacob wrote this       against sin. Jacob recorded that after Nephi’s death
                    record while living in the land of Nephi.                  (see Jacob 1:9), the people began to engage in certain

           how the choices you are making to be chaste and
           clean delight the Lord.
           You can remain clean. If you have already sinned
           against the law of chastity, you can repent and become
           clean through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Seek the
           guidance of the Holy Spirit as you think of one or more
           ways you can better guard yourself against breaking
           the law of chastity. If you have committed any sexual
           transgressions, do whatever is necessary, including
           meeting with your bishop or branch president, to
           confess what you have done in violation of the Lord’s
           law of chastity.

           It may be helpful to know that being “presented as the                      with my teacher:
           first-fruits of Christ unto God” (Jacob 4:11) refers to
           standing before God worthy of entering the celestial
           kingdom. Also, it is important to understand that if we
           are to have “a hope of [the Savior’s] glory” (Jacob 4:4),                    Unit 10: Day 1
           we must believe that Jesus Christ has provided the way
           for us to be redeemed from our sins and be resurrected
           so we can return to the presence of Heavenly Father.                        Jacob 5–6
           One truth we can learn in Jacob 4 is this: Through the
           Atonement of Jesus Christ, we can be filled with                            Introduction
           hope and reconcile ourselves with God.

           A vineyard is a section of land used to plant grapevines and olive trees. Olive trees were extremely valuable in ancient Israel. Olives were used
           for food, and olive oil was used for cooking, medicine, and fuel for lamps. However, olive trees required much care and labor to help them
           produce good fruit.

                    help the vineyard produce good fruit, eventually all
                    the fruit of the vineyard became corrupt (see Jacob

                    Because the trees were producing bad fruit despite
                    all He had done, the Lord of the vineyard considered
                    cutting down all of the trees (see Jacob 5:49). Read

                     Words of
                     Mormon–Mosiah 2
                     Introduction
                     The Words of Mormon serves as a bridge between the
                     small plates of Nephi and Mormon’s abridgement of
                     the large plates of Nephi. Written almost 400 years
                     after the birth of Jesus Christ, this book contains a
                     short explanation of what the small plates of Nephi are
                     and why Mormon felt they needed to be included with
                     the other sacred writings. The Words of Mormon also
                     provides valuable insight into why King Benjamin had
                     such great influence with his people.
                     The small plates of Nephi were mainly devoted to the
                     spiritual matters and the ministry and teachings of the
                     prophets. The large plates of Nephi contained mostly
                     a secular history of the people written by the kings,
                     starting with Nephi. (See 1 Nephi 9:2–4.) From the
                     time of Mosiah, however, the large plates also included
                     items of major spiritual importance.
                     The plates of Mormon, or the gold plates delivered
                     to Joseph Smith, contained an abridgment by               Words of Mormon 1:1–11
                     Mormon from the large plates of Nephi, with many          Mormon teaches that God has preserved various records
                     commentaries. These gold plates also contained a
                                                                               for a wise purpose
                     continuation of the history by Mormon and additions
                     by his son Moroni.                                        Think about a time when you felt prompted by the
                                                                               Spirit to do something. Did you know how everything
                                         Words of Mormon                       would turn out if you followed this prompting? What
                                                                               gave you the determination and confidence to act on
                                                            Mosiah to          the prompting?

                  2. King Benjamin taught that we must “believe in God”
                  (Mosiah 4:9) and always remember “the greatness of                                     Thoughts
           God” (Mosiah 4:11). In your scripture study journal, describe
           what experiences you or someone you know have has that have

           remember these things, how do they affect your life?
           King Benjamin described the actions of people who are
           trying to retain a remission of their sins. Study Mosiah

                     Introduction
                     King Mosiah was the son of King Benjamin, who was
                     the son of the first Mosiah mentioned in the Book
                     of Mormon. Approximately 80 years before Mosiah
                     became king, a man named Zeniff led a group of
                     Nephites from Zarahemla to return to live in the land
                     of Nephi (see Omni 1:27–30). Mosiah 7 explains that
                     King Mosiah authorized “a strong and mighty man”
                     named Ammon (Mosiah 7:3) and a small group to
                     travel to the land of Nephi (sometimes called the land
                     of Lehi-Nephi) and determine the fate of Zeniff’s
                     group. Ammon discovered the descendants of Zeniff’s
                     people, who were now led by Zeniff’s grandson
                     Limhi. Ammon’s arrival brought hope to Limhi and
                     his people, whose iniquities had allowed them to be
                     placed in bondage to the Lamanites. Earlier, while
                     attempting to find Zarahemla and ask for help, a group
                     of Limhi’s people found 24 gold plates with engravings
                     on them. When Limhi asked Ammon if he could
                     translate the engravings, Ammon explained that a seer,
                     like King Mosiah, could translate the ancient records.

                     Overview of Mosiah 7–24
                     Have you ever wanted to be delivered from bad
                     feelings, a painful situation, a challenging or oppressive
                     circumstance, or guilt from sin? The experiences of the
                     people you will study about in Mosiah 7–24 can teach
                     you about deliverance—where to seek it, how to invite
                     it, and even how to wait for it. Watch for ways you can
                     apply the stories of Zeniff’s people and their descendants
                     to your own life, including a desire for deliverance from
                     something oppressing you.
                     Before studying Mosiah 7, it will be helpful for you to
                     become familiar with the various journeys recorded in
                     Mosiah 7–24. The following activity will provide you
                     with an overview of these journeys, which occurred
                     during a period of approximately 80 years (200 B.C. to
                     120 B.C.). The information in the shaded boxes on the
                     chart explains what happened between the journeys.

             Journey      Who Traveled Where                                          4            Limhi sent a group of Nephites to find Zarahemla.
                                                                                                   After becoming lost in the wilderness, the group
             1            Zeniff and other Nephites traveled from                                  discovered the ruins of a destroyed nation and
                          Zarahemla to the land of Nephi, which had                                a record written on 24 gold plates (see Mosiah

                          fought among themselves, and the survivors
                          returned to Zarahemla (see Omni 1:27–28;                    5            Ammon and 15 others journeyed from Zarahelma
                          Mosiah 9:1–2).                                                           to find those who had returned to the land of
                                                                                                   Nephi (see Mosiah 7:1–6; 21:22–24).
             2            Zeniff and others left Zarahemla and settled in
                          the land of Nephi (see Omni 1:29–30; Mosiah                 6            Limhi and his people escaped from the Lamanites
                          9:3–7).                                                                  and were led by Ammon and his brethren to
                                                                                                   Zarahemla (see Mosiah 22:10–13).
             After Zeniff died, his son Noah reigned in wickedness. The Lord
             sent the prophet Abinadi to warn the people to repent. Alma,             After Limhi’s people escaped, the Lamanites sent an army
             one of King Noah’s priests, obeyed Abinadi’s message and                 after them. The army was lost in the wilderness when they
             taught it to others (see Mosiah 11–18).                                  discovered Alma and his people in the land of Helam. The
                                                                                      Lamanites brought them into bondage. Alma’s people prayed
             3            Alma escaped to the Waters of Mormon and later              for help to escape (see Mosiah 22–24).
                          led a group of believers to the land of Helam (see
                          Mosiah 18:4–5, 32–35; 23:1–5, 19–20).                       7            The Lord delivered Alma and his people and guided
                                                                                                   them to Zarahemla (see Mosiah 24:20–25).
             The Lamanites attacked Noah’s people in the land of Nephi.
             Noah was later killed, and his son Limhi reigned. The people of
                                                                                    Place the number of each journey in the appropriate

                     Mosiah 7:1–8:4
                     Ammon finds the land of Nephi (Lehi–Nephi), and King
                     Limhi describes how his people came into bondage
                     In Mosiah 7, Ammon and 15 other strong men traveled
                     from Zarahemla to learn what happened to the people
                     whom Zeniff had led to the land of Nephi 80 years
                     earlier (see Mosiah 7:2; see also journey 5 on the map).
                     Upon their arrival in the land of Nephi, Ammon and
                     three of his brethren were seized and cast into prison
                     (see Mosiah 7:6–11). After two days they were brought
                     out of prison and questioned by King Limhi, who was
                     Zeniff’s grandson. Read Mosiah 7:12–15 to see how
                     Ammon explained his presence in the land of Nephi
                     and how Limhi responded.                                    Lamanites attacked and the people were brought into

                   or family member teaching him or her how to turn to the
           Lord. Share the three phrases from Mosiah 7:33 you discovered,
           and explain the meaning of each phrase by either (1) putting it
           in your own words or (2) giving an example of what actions or
           attitudes we might see in the life of someone who was striving
           to apply that phrase.
           Consider if you have sins you have not repented of
           that could be causing sorrow and regret for you and
           those you love. Elder Richard G. Scott of the Quorum
           of the Twelve Apostles provided the following counsel
           about beginning the repentance process: “Study and
           ponder to determine how serious the Lord defines your
           transgression to be. That will bring healing sorrow and
           remorse. It will also bring a sincere desire for change
           and a willingness to submit to every requirement for
           forgiveness” (“Finding Forgiveness,” Ensign, May
           1995, 76).

           To help you understand Jesus Christ’s role as                 Sometimes people are confused by Abinadi’s description
           Redeemer, consider the following diagram:                     of Jesus Christ in Mosiah 15:2–5 as (1) the Son of God

           penalties? Can you think of any legal and honest way

                     I thought of the Savior’s experience in the garden
                     and on the cross as places where a large mass of sin
                     was heaped upon Him. Through the words of Alma,
                     Abinadi, Isaiah, and other prophets, however, my
                     view has changed. Instead of an impersonal mass
                     of sin, there was a long line of people, as Jesus felt
                     ‘our infirmities’ (Hebrews 4:15), ‘[bore] our griefs,
                     . . . carried our sorrows . . . [and] was bruised for our
                     iniquities’ (Isaiah 53:4–5).
                     “The Atonement was an intimate, personal experience
                     in which Jesus came to know how to help each of
                     us” (“A Pattern for All,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2005,
                     75–76).

                            3. Answer the following questions in your scripture
                            journal:
                     a. What do you think it means to become the seed of Jesus
                     Christ? (see Mosiah 15:12).
                     b. What are you doing to make sure you are numbered among
                     the seed of Jesus Christ?
                     You may wish to personalize Mosiah 15:10 by writing
                     your name in place of “his seed” in the portion of the
                     verse that you have underlined. Ponder for a moment
                     what it means to have a Redeemer who has seen and
                     knows you personally.
                     What are the consequences of someone refusing to be
                     redeemed? Look again at Mosiah 16:5. What happens
                     in the diagram depicted earlier in this lesson if the
                     offender persists in sin and refuses to repent? Read
                     Doctrine and Covenants 19:16–17 to discover what
                     will happen to those who refuse to accept the Savior’s
                     redeeming act through repentance.
                     Abinadi taught that the redemption of Jesus Christ                  Mosiah 17
                     includes not only a rescue from sin but also from death.
                     Everyone will be resurrected; however, some will be                 Alma believes Abinadi and is cast out; Abinadi is killed
                     resurrected before others. Abinadi used the term “first             Have you ever witnessed someone stand up for what
                     resurrection” to explain that the righteous and innocent            was right when it was difficult for him or her to do so?
                     would be resurrected before the rebellious (see Mosiah              What was the outcome?
                     15:21–22). The righteous will be redeemed from
                                                                                         When Abinadi concluded his message, one of the

                     wait to be resurrected until after the Millennium (see
                                                                                         Abinadi had spoken the truth and should be released.

                            4. Reflect upon the verses you have studied in Mosiah 15.

                     a message from you to the Savior. Record what you would write in    the words of Abinadi, many generations and peoples
                     that message, based upon what He has done for you.                  have been blessed. The fruits of Alma’s conversion will

                     The Savior wants to bring us back into the presence
                                                                                         The king and his priests counseled together for three

           Mosiah 27
           Introduction
           Mosiah 27 recounts the conversion of Alma (the son
           of Alma) and the sons of King Mosiah. It tells of their
           rebellious attempts to destroy the Church of God, the
           visitation of an angel, Alma’s miraculous change, and
           the efforts of these young men to repair the harm they
           had done. The account of Alma’s conversion emphasizes
           the need for all individuals to be born again and to live

           An angel calls Alma the Younger and the sons of Mosiah

           Think about those you know who do not have
           testimonies of the gospel or have fallen away from the
           Church. What would you do if one of them refused all
           of your efforts to help him or her? Look for insights
           into this question as you study today.

           you would feel if someone you loved wanted to go live
           among a violent people who hated those who were
           not like them. Read Mosiah 28:5–9, and identify why
           Mosiah let his sons go on such a dangerous mission.
           In the book of Alma, you will learn about the “many
           [who] shall believe on their words” (Mosiah 28:7)—
           the thousands of Lamanites who were converted as a
           result of the efforts of the sons of Mosiah.
                                                                                         3. Write in your scripture study journal what King

           Mosiah translates the Jaredite plates and gives all the               previous actions, recorded in Mosiah 27.) Also, explain how
           records he kept to Alma                                               Mosiah’s trust in Alma might give hope to those who repent.
           The remainder of Mosiah 28 records that King Mosiah
           was growing older and felt the need to select the next                Mosiah 29
           caretaker of the sacred records before he died. For the

           the records. Included in these records were the Jaredite              a king, but by a system of judges. Read and compare

               Who Wrote This Book?
               Mormon compiled and abridged records from the
               large plates of Nephi to create the book of Alma.
               The book is named for Alma, who was the son of
               Alma and is often called Alma the Younger. At the
               time King Mosiah instituted the reign of the judges
               among the Nephites, Alma became the first chief
               judge and also succeeded his father as high priest
               over the Church (see Mosiah 29:42). He eventually
               resigned his position as chief judge to dedicate
               himself “wholly to the high priesthood” and “to
               deliver the word of God to the people” throughout
               all the land of the Nephites (Alma 4:20; 5:1). Mormon
               used the records of Alma’s ministry (Alma 1– 44) and
               the writings of his sons Helaman (Alma 45–62) and
               Shiblon (Alma 63) to compose the book of Alma.
                                                                         Alma 1
               When and Where Was It Written?                            Church members prosper despite the spread of priestcraft
               The original records used as sources for the book of      and persecution
               Alma were likely written between 91 B.C. and 52 B.C.
                                                                         People sometimes seek to be popular. Take a moment
               Mormon abridged those records sometime between
                                                                         to think about the possible dangers of this desire. What

                     God and His gospel. Priestcraft is a serious sin in God’s
                     eyes, as Alma made clear when he told Nehor, “Were                   a. When have you kept the commandments despite persecution
                                                                                          or pressure not to do so, and what blessings did you receive?
                     priestcraft to be enforced among this people it would
                     prove their entire destruction” (Alma 1:12).                         b. How will you respond to your adversaries?

                     As Nehor tried to “lead away the people of the
                     church,” a righteous man named Gideon “withstood                     Alma 2
                     him, admonishing him with the words of God” (Alma                    The Amlicites and the Lamanites join in battle against the
                     1:7). In response, Nehor drew his sword and slew                     Nephites
                     Gideon. Nehor stood trial for his crimes and was                     Alma 2 tells about further trials for the Nephites.
                     executed. Read Alma 1:16 to discover if Nehor’s death                Read the chapter heading to find out how a man
                     ended priestcraft among the Nephites.                                named Amlici and his followers opposed the
                     Read Alma 1:26–27, and identify ways the Nephite                     Nephites. Amlici wanted to become king over the
                     priests of God acted differently from Nehor and others               Nephites, but the Nephites held a vote and chose to
                     who practiced priestcrafts.                                          reject him and continue with their system of judges.
                                                                                          The followers of Amlici gathered together and made

                     different from the actions of those who practiced priestcraft?       the Lamanites joined the Amlicites in fighting the

                     As priestcraft spread throughout the land, many people
                     began to persecute the faithful members of the Church.               Because the Nephites were faithful to the Lord, the

                     you have seen other people tease, mock, or persecute                 and the Lamanites. Read Alma 2:18, 28–31, 36, and

                     persecuted members of the Church. Alma 1:21–31

           The Amlicites’ change in appearance was a
           manifestation of their rebellion. As recorded in Alma 3,
           Mormon reminded us of the curse and the mark that          Alma 4
           had come upon the Lamanites hundreds of years              After a period of Church growth, Church members become
           earlier because of their rebellion against God (see        proud and Alma resigns as chief judge to call them to
           Alma 3:6–10; see also 2 Nephi 5:20–24). The Amlicites      repentance
           had voluntarily put marks on their foreheads, but these

           marks served a purpose that was similar to the mark

                     After leaving Zarahemla, Alma talked with the people
                     in the city of Gideon. Read Alma 7:3–6 to see what                    Pains
                     spiritual condition Alma hoped to find among the
                     people in Gideon. Then read Alma 7:17–19 to find
                     out whether Alma’s hopes were confirmed. On the                       Affliction

                     Read Alma 7:7–10, and look for the event Alma felt
                     was most important for the people to know about and
                                                                                           Sicknesses

                     already had strong faith (see Alma 7:17) that they needed to
                     repent in order to prepare for the coming of the Savior? (See
                     Romans 3:23.)                                                         Infirmitie

                     Alma taught the people of Gideon this important
                     principle: Jesus Christ suffered to save us from sin                  Sins
                     and death and to help us through the challenges
                     of mortality. Read Alma 7:11–13, and mark in your

           during that time?

                 Scripture Mastery—Alma 7:11–13
           While Alma 7:11–13 is a long scripture mastery
           passage, it contains specific words that can help you
           remember the extent and power of the Atonement
           throughout your life. To help you memorize these key
           words, rewrite Alma 7:11–13 on a separate sheet of
           paper, leaving out the words found in the chart earlier
           in this lesson. Read through your written version of
           this scripture until you can fill in the missing words
           without looking at your scriptures. You may want to
           review these verses over the next few days to help you
           remember what the Savior can do for you and others
           throughout your life. Test your scripture mastery of
           Alma 7:11–13 by reciting it aloud to yourself or to
           a family member or friend or by writing it in your
           scripture study journal.

                     command, Alma returned to Ammonihah. The Lord
                     prepared Amulek to receive Alma in Ammonihah and
                     join him in testifying to the people. Alma and Amulek
                     warned the people of Ammonihah that if they did not
                     repent, they would be destroyed. Amulek faithfully
                     obeyed God and used his reputation, good name, and
                     influence to support the prophet Alma and testify of
                     Jesus Christ.

                     God” in Alma 8:4 refers to the priesthood, as you will     earlier. How might the angel’s words have been

                     to Ammonihah to preach. He had a very different
                     experience with the people who lived there. Study        Despite the difficulty of the command, Alma “returned

                     happened to Alma while he was in Ammonihah:              loves such obedience: “Surely the Lord loves, more

           Alma 9
           Alma warns the people of Ammonihah to repent and
           prepare for the coming of Jesus Christ
           Alma 9 records Alma’s efforts to teach the people
           of Ammonihah about their need to repent and be
           redeemed through the Savior, Jesus Christ. To try to
           help these wicked people recognize their need to
           repent, Alma called upon them to remember what
           God had done for them and for their fathers.
           Look in Alma 9:8–10, 13 for repetition of the words
           remember and forgotten. How do you think the
           inhabitants of Ammonihah would have been different
           if they had remembered the things Alma spoke of?

                   3. Answer the following question in your scripture study
                   journal: Why do you think it is important to remember the   Amulek recounted how an angel instructed him to
           spiritual experiences you have had in the past? Then write about    take Alma into his home and care for him. Read Alma
           one spiritual experience that you do not want to forget.            10:7–11, and look for how Amulek and others were
                                                                               blessed because Amulek obeyed the angel.
           After calling the people in Ammonihah to repent, Alma
           taught them that they should prepare for the time when              Write this principle next to Alma 10:11–12: When we
           the Savior would come to earth. Read Alma 9:26–27, and              hear and obey the Lord’s call, blessings come to
           mark words and phrases that help you better understand              us and to others. There are many ways the Lord can
           characteristics of the Savior. (The word equity means               “call” to us—through a prompting from the Spirit;
           fairness and justice.) What do these words and phrases              through a feeling; through a dream; through the words
           teach you about the Savior? During the coming week,                 of a Church leader, teacher, or parent; through being
           take time to think about them.                                      called to a Church position; through adversity; or
                                                                               through other ways.
           Alma 10
                                                                                      4. In your scripture study journal, answer the following
           Amulek describes his experience with an angel and exhorts                  question: When have you felt you were blessed because
           the people to repent                                                you obeyed a “call” from the Lord?

           • I woke up on my own, without using an alarm or                    words. Amulek warned them that if they did not
             being called by someone.                                          repent, the day would come when they would be
           • I woke up the first time my alarm went off or the first           destroyed. Read Alma 10:22–23, and identify why the
             time I was called.                                                people were being saved from destruction at that time.
                                                                               What do these verses teach you about the importance
           • My alarm went off several times, or I had to be called
                                                                               of being righteous even when those around you are
             several times before I awoke.
                                                                               not?
           Read Alma 10:6, and look for how many spiritual
           “wake-up calls” Amulek received while he continued                         5. Write the following at the bottom of today’s

                     tried to get him to deny the true and living God. As

                                            Amulek testifies of the
                                            Son of God and overcomes

           upon or applied, the learning
                                        Zeezrom attacked
           is not complete and the Spirit
           may cease to work with the   Amulek’s faith in Jesus

           your heart and mind what you after Zeezrom failed to
           learn and then act and live  get Amulek to deny the
           according to that truth.     existence of God, think
                                        of a time when perhaps
                                        someone opposed your
           beliefs. Read Amulek and Zeezrom’s dialogue in Alma
           11:26–34, and then look at how Zeezrom twisted
           Amulek’s words in Alma 11:35.
           Read how Amulek corrected this falsehood in Alma
           11:36–37. You may want to mark footnote 34a in your
           scriptures, and read Helaman 5:10–11. Then explain in
           your own words the difference between being saved
           “in our sins” and being saved “from our sins” (italics
           added):



           Read Alma 11:40, and identify the first step Amulek
           said people must take to be saved from their sins.
           There are some people who claim to believe in Jesus
           Christ yet they don’t want to change their behavior.
           To believe on the name of Jesus Christ means to have
           faith in Him.
                         To better understand how “believing on his
                         name” (having faith in Jesus Christ) leads
                         to repentance, read the following quotation
                         from President Dieter F. Uchtdorf of the

                            to repent? Using what you have learned from Amulek and        He emphasized the snares of Satan, the judgments that
                     President Uchtdorf, write in your scripture study journal how you    befall the wicked, and the plan of redemption provided

                     Amulek teaches about the resurrection and judgment of                Alma exposes Zeezrom’s wicked intentions

                     Before you read the conclusion of Amulek’s testimony                 of rope is placed around a piece of food. As the animal
                     to Zeezrom, reflect on the following question: How                   reaches through the loop to take the food, the snare is
                     might someone’s actions be affected by not believing                 tightened, and the animal is trapped.

                             4. Write the words Resurrection and Judgment as two
                             separate column headings in your scripture study journal.
                     Then search Alma 11:41– 45, looking for as much information as
                     you can find about resurrection and judgment, and write what
                     you learn under each heading. You may want to write at the top
                     of the page in your scriptures or in your scripture study journal:
                     Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, all will be
                     resurrected and judged according to their works. These
                     verses also teach that resurrection means the reuniting of our       Review how Zeezrom tried to catch Amulek in a snare in
                     bodies with our spirits in their “perfect form” and “proper          Alma 11:21–25. After Amulek perceived Zeezrom’s intent

                     about being resurrected and judged?                                  from the devil (see Alma 12:5).
                     b. How does your belief that you will be resurrected and judged      According to Alma 12:3, how was Alma able to know
                     affect the way you choose to live each day?                          Zeezrom’s plan?

           [1966], 633).
           After Alma warned the people of Ammonihah to
           prepare for the coming of Christ (see Alma 13:21–26),
           he provided additional instruction on how to enter
           the Lord’s rest. Read Alma 13:27–29 to see what those
           instructions were.
           Alma’s teachings can be summarized by the following
           principle: As we respond humbly to the invitation
           to repent, the Spirit will ultimately lead us into the

           Zeezrom is healed, a Lamanite army destroys Ammonihah,
           and Alma and Amulek continue to preach to the Nephites
           After leaving Ammonihah, Alma and Amulek went to
           the nearby city of Sidom, where they found the believers
           from Ammonihah, including Zeezrom. Read Alma
           15:3–5 to discover Zeezrom’s condition.
           Consider the following: What caused Zeezrom’s
           illness? What did Zeezrom do to obtain relief and
           peace?
           Carefully read Alma 15:6–10, and underline two or
           three phrases that show that Alma helped Zeezrom
           focus on Jesus Christ and His Atonement. To
           understand one way priesthood leaders can help
           people receive mercy through the Atonement, read

           committed serious transgressions. . . .
           “A young single adult in our ward was dating a young
           woman. They allowed their affections to get out of
           control. He came to me for counsel and help. Based on      One principle you could write in your scriptures or
           what was confessed and the impressions of the Spirit       scripture study journal for Alma 15:6–12 is: Through

           to ensure that repentance had happened, and, after an      this principle evident in Amulek’s life?

                            1. Review Alma 17:2– 4. In your scripture study journal,
                            do the following:
                     a. List what the sons of Mosiah did to prepare to be effective
                     missionaries, and describe the results of their preparation.
                     b. Select something these missionaries did that you would like to
                     do better in your life, or a characteristic you would like to develop
                     more completely. Write a paragraph about how you can do this.
                                                                                             Read Alma 17:9, and underline what the sons of Mosiah
                     Ponder how often you pray and search the scriptures                     prayed for as they prepared to serve. Read Alma 17:11,
                     individually and in your family, and think of the                       and reflect upon what the Lord told them about how to

                  2. In your scripture study journal, write about a situation
                  in which you feel you could be a good example. Think
           about school settings, situations at home with your family or with
           extended family, and social settings that are face-to-face or online.
           Describe how you will show a good example in that situation.
           It is harder to be a good example in some situations
           than others. Look at how the Lamanites are described
           in Alma 17:12–16, and think about why the sons of
           Mosiah would have had a hard time teaching in this
           situation.
           Why do you think the sons of Mosiah were willing to
           suffer afflictions in order to help a people who hated
           the Nephites? To help you understand what the sons
           of Mosiah hoped to accomplish, fill in the blank with a
           word from Alma 17:16: The sons of Mosiah wanted the
           Lamanites to be brought unto --------------------, because
           they wanted the Lamanites to know of the plan of
           redemption.

           others, complete this assignment within the next few
           days: Ask a family member or a friend to tell you how
           someone’s Christlike example has made a difference in

                                    the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ as            Because of Ammon’s testimony and example, many

           Think about how all of the servants of the king were
           affected by the events with Ammon, Lamoni, and
           Lamoni’s wife. In Alma 19:15–17, highlight any words                  Alma 20

           Read Alma 19:18–22 to see how the people who

                     Lamoni’s position as you study this chapter.
                     Read Alma 20:1–7 to see what happened when Lamoni
                     wanted to introduce Ammon to his father, who was                     Alma 21–22
                     the king over all the Lamanites. Then read each of the
                     following groups of verses and ponder your answers to                Introduction
                     the accompanying questions.

                      Alma 20:17–25         How did Ammon respond to the anger            eventually receive eternal life. The faithfulness of Aaron

                                            demonstrate love for Lamoni?                  know God and His way of redemption.


                     Read Alma 20:26–27 to see the effects of Ammon’s
                     response. What did Lamoni’s father desire to learn
                     after seeing the love Ammon showed?


                     What can we learn from Ammon’s response to the
                     anger of Lamoni’s father?


                     Write the following truth in your scriptures by Alma
                     20:26–27 or in your scripture study journal: As we act
                     with love, it can lead others to soften their hearts
                     and seek to know the truth. Consider when you might
                     have opportunities in your home, with your friends, or
                     at school to respond to other people’s anger with love.

                          5. Write a goal in your scripture study journal describing
                          how you can better respond to anger with love, as
                     Ammon did with the king of the Lamanites.
                            6. Write the following at the bottom of today’s

                                                                                          the following questions: What did you do to be faithful
                                                                                          despite the trials you faced? As you look back on the

           Ponder how you would answer the two questions that
           Elder Scott asked. As you study Alma 23–24, think about
           why many members of the Church remain faithful to
                                                                                  Alma 24

           After the king of the Lamanites became converted
                                                                                  As recorded in Alma 24:3, the king of the

                                                                                  Lamanites conferred the kingdom upon his son
           among all his people, and a miracle occurred.
                                                                                  just before his death, and he gave his son the name

           how the miracle occurred.
                                                                                  brethren to hold a council with the king. When it
           Read Alma 23:6–7. How many of the thousands who                        became known that the unconverted Lamanites
           were “converted unto the Lord” remained converted                      were going to war against the Anti-Nephi-Lehies,
           throughout their lives?                                                these righteous people decided they would make
                                                                                  no preparations to defend themselves (see Alma

           After these Lamanites were converted, they wanted
                                                                                  Anti-Nephi-Lehies made this decision.
           to be called by a new name so they would no longer
           be known as Lamanites. Read Alma 23:16–18, and
           identify the name they chose and the blessings that                            5. In your scripture study journal, write what you learn
           came to them because of their faithfulness.                                    from the Anti-Nephi-Lehies about what it means to
                                                                                  forsake our sins when we repent.
                    2. In your scripture study journal, under the figure
                    labeled “Faithful,” write what you have learned from the
           Anti-Nephi-Lehies about being faithful to the Lord throughout
           your life.
           Write the following truth in your scriptures or scripture
           study journal: Conversion means spiritually changing
           and becoming a new person through the power of
           God. Just as the Anti-Nephi-Lehies changed, if you are
           willing to receive the power of the Atonement in your
           life by your faith and repentance, you can become a new
           person through the power of God and remain converted
           throughout your life.
           Look again at Elder Scott’s two questions, and then
           read his answer: “True conversion is the fruit of faith,
           repentance, and consistent obedience. . . . True conversion
           will strengthen your capacity to do what you know
           you should do, when you should do it, regardless
           of the circumstances” (“Full Conversion Brings
           Happiness,” 25).

                    3. Answer the following question in your scripture study
                    journal: According to Alma 23:18, the converted Lamanites
           began to be industrious and friendly with the Nephites. When people
           are trying to repent and change their lives, why is it important for
           them to associate with others who are also striving to live
           righteously?

                     Anti-Nephi-Lehies did to show the Lord they had                    made to the Lord. They had given their lives completely
                     truly repented. Why did the people bury their swords               to the Lord, and they remained completely faithful to
                     and other weapons deep in the ground? (See Alma                    Him throughout their lives.

           Alma 25–29
           Introduction
           After years of preaching the gospel, Ammon praised
           the Lord and expressed gratitude for the blessing
           of being an instrument in His hands to bring the
           gospel to the Lamanites. Many Lamanites began to
           believe in the Lord, repented, and called themselves
           the Anti-Nephi-Lehies. After the Anti-Nephi-Lehies
           made a covenant with God to never again take up
           weapons of war, the Amalekites and Lamanites began
           to make preparations to go to battle against them.
           To help them keep their covenant with the Lord, the       Church, and the phrase that those who are gathered
           Anti-Nephi-Lehies accepted an offer of protection         “are not wasted” refers to God preserving the converts
           from the Nephites. The Nephite prophet Alma               and granting them eternal life.
           expressed the joy he felt from preaching the gospel
                                                                     Identify or mark one or more phrases in Alma 26:12

           inspired prophecies (see Alma 25:9). It also tells

           what these Lamanites did as they became converted                1. In your scripture study journal, write why you think we

                                                                    Following a great battle with the Lamanites, peace

                                                                    period of peace, a man named Korihor began to preach
                                                                    that there would be no Christ. His false teachings led
                                                                    those who believed him to sin. He spoke against the
                                                                    leaders of the Church, claiming they were teaching
                                                                    “foolish traditions” (Alma 30:27). Korihor was brought
                                                                    before Alma, who taught him that all things testify of
                                                                    Christ. Eventually, Korihor confessed that his actions
                                                                    were guided by the devil.

                                                                    Alma 30:1–29
           Remembering what had happened to Alma as a young         Korihor, an anti-Christ, ridicules the doctrine of Christ
           man, consider why Alma might have had the desire he      Imagine that someone prepared a meal for you. It
           expressed. Notice in Alma 29:3 why he felt that he was   looked and smelled delicious, but when you ate it, you

           what the Lord grants to those who have righteous         teachings might be similar to being offered food that
           desires.                                                 looks delicious but is secretly poisonous.

           Read Alma 30:32–35, and discover Alma’s response
           to Korihor. Think about how you have seen the

           followed. Note that experiments require action on
           the part of the researcher. Likewise, the process of             Alma 32:28         Alma 32:30         Alma 32:30–34
           receiving or strengthening a testimony requires action
           on your part. Read Alma 32:27, and look for the              Read Alma 32:29–34, and mark the words or phrases

           sins now, rather than waiting to repent later. Read Alma          Helaman that God will deliver those who put their trust
           34:30–35, and underline words or phrases that identify            in Him. To illustrate this truth, Alma described how he

           President Boyd K. Packer of the Quorum of the Twelve
           Apostles helped us understand what racked and
           harrowed up mean:
                          “Racked means ‘tortured.’ Anciently a rack
                          was a framework on which the victim was
                          laid with each ankle and wrist tied to a
                          spindle which could then be turned to
                          cause unbearable pain.
                         “A harrow is a frame with spikes through
           it. When pulled across the ground, it rips and tears into
           the soil. The scriptures frequently speak of souls and
           minds being ‘harrowed up’ with guilt” (“The Touch of
           the Master’s Hand,” Ensign, May 2001, 23).

                  1. In your scripture study journal, write why you think
                  Alma used such strong words to describe how he felt.
           Also write how these words describe the guilt and pain of a
           person who has sinned and not repented.
           You may want to write the following truth in your
           scriptures near Alma 36:11–16: Sin can lead to pain
           and regret.
           Read Alma 36:17–18, and look for what Alma
           remembered his father prophesying about. Notice
           what Alma did when he remembered what his father
           had taught him.
           Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve
           Apostles gave the following insight into Alma’s
           experience: “Alma had been touched by the teaching                  study journal, and explain what they teach you about the power
           of his father, but it is particularly important that the            of the Savior’s Atonement.
           prophecy he remembered was one regarding ‘the                       From these scriptures we learn this principle: If we
           coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for              exercise faith in the Atonement of Jesus Christ,
           the sins of the world.’ (Alma 36:17.) That is the name              then He will deliver us from the pain of our sins
           and that is the message that every person must hear.                and fill us with joy. Ponder what you can do to
           Alma heard it, and he cried out from the anguish of a               exercise more faith in Jesus Christ so that, like Alma,
           hell that kept burning and a conscience that wouldn’t               you can be delivered from feelings of pain or remorse
           heal. ‘O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me.’                 for your sins.
           (Alma 36:18.) . . . Whatever other prayers we offer,
                                                                               Read the following situation, and consider how you
           whatever other needs we have, all somehow depends
                                                                               might respond: A friend who has been reading the
           on that plea: ‘O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy
                                                                               Book of Mormon asks you for help in understanding
           on me.’ He is prepared to provide that mercy. He paid
                                                                               Alma’s words in Alma 36:19. Your friend asks, “If I can

                                                                               remember my sins and still feel sorry for them, does it

                   the blessings of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, including   Uchtdorf of the First Presidency, and underline any
           the blessing of forgiveness for a sin. In your scripture study      phrases you believe would be helpful to your friend:

                     him, because he knew he had been forgiven (see Alma               your testimony of the Savior and His restored gospel.
                     36:17–19).                                                        Ponder how you might share with this person your

                     sins] no more’ [D&C 58:42]” (“Point of Safe Return,”              when you will speak with the person.

                     It is also important to note that Alma did not say
                     that he remembered his sins no more but that he
                     remembered the pain of his sins no more, and he
                     was no longer “harrowed up” by their memory
                     (Alma 36:19). True repentance will cause the pain
                     and guilt of sin to be swept away (see Enos 1:6–8).

                     Alma taught Corianton the seriousness of his actions
                     and expressed his disappointment that Corianton was               “Physical intimacy between husband and wife is

                     Corianton to stop going after “the lusts of his eyes” and         creation of children and for the expression of love

           truths taught in these                                               would “appease the demands of justice” (Alma 42:15)

                  Final Judgment to be fair? Why might you want your                 physical death (a separation of the body and spirit at

           Many people might respond to this question by                  President Boyd K. Packer, President of the Quorum
           suggesting that if we repent, we will not have to suffer       of the Twelve Apostles, referred to Jesus Christ as a

           to erase or forgive the consequences would be unjust           look for how the Savior is needed for mercy to be
           because the demands of justice would not be met. Alma          extended to the sinner:
           taught that dismissing the penalty without satisfying

                     It is important to know that Corianton repented and
                     ultimately had a great impact on the growth of the

                     Alma 43–44
                     Introduction
                     In Alma 43–44, Mormon began to write about the
                     wars between the Lamanites and Nephites. As Alma
                     and his sons continued to minister to the people, the
                     Zoramites joined with the Lamanite army to attack
                     the Nephites. Captain Moroni demonstrated faith
                     and wisdom in defending the Nephites against the
                     Lamanite army. Even though they were outnumbered,
                     the Nephite army’s preparation and their faith in Jesus              joined the Lamanites in their preparation to attack
                     Christ gave them the advantage in battle. When they                  the Nephites. Read Alma 43:5–8, and identify the
                     knew they would be defeated, the Lamanites made a                    “designs” (plans) of the Lamanite leader Zerahemnah.
                     covenant of peace and departed out of the land for a                 You may wish to mark Zerahemnah’s intentions as you
                     season.                                                              discover them. Ponder how Zerahemnah’s designs or
                                                                                          desires for the Nephites may be like the designs Satan
                                                                                          might have for you.
                     Alma 43
                     Captain Moroni’s preparations and strategies help frustrate          Next read Alma 43:9–11, and identify the designs or
                     the designs of the Lamanite army                                     desires of the Nephites. Now ponder how these desires
                                                                                          may be similar to the righteous desires you have.
                             1. In your scripture study journal, write a list of some     Captain Moroni, the chief captain of the Nephite
                             of your plans, goals, and desires for your future. As you
                                                                                          armies, prepared his people to defend their land and
                     write, consider including spiritual goals and desires, such as a
                                                                                          families from the evil intentions of Zerahemnah. Read
                     mission, temple marriage, and family.
                                                                                          Alma 43:16–19, looking for what preparations Captain
                     After you are done writing your list, identify the                   Moroni and the Nephites made.
                     desires and goals you feel Satan would not want
                     you to accomplish. As you study Alma 43–44, look                           2. In your scripture study journal, draw two of the things
                     for principles that will help you accomplish your                          that Moroni gave to his men to prepare them for war.
                     righteous goals despite the efforts of the adversary
                                                                                          Now read Alma 43:20–22 to discover how the
                     to prevent your success.
                                                                                          Lamanites reacted to the Nephite preparations. Ponder
                     In Alma 43:1–4, despite Alma’s efforts to bring the                  why the Lamanites withdrew their attack even though
                     Zoramites back into the Church, many of them                         they outnumbered the Nephites.

           As we study the accounts of physical battles in the
           Book of Mormon, we can liken them to the spiritual
           battles we face.

                   3. Answer the following question in your scripture study
                   journal: What can you learn from Moroni’s preparations
           for war about defending yourself against Satan’s attacks and
           temptations?
           After the Lamanites retreated, Moroni did not know
           where his enemies would attack next. If you were
           Moroni, what might you do to try to prepare for
           another attack?


           Read Alma 43:23–24 to find out what Moroni did.
           From Moroni’s example we learn: If we seek and
           follow prophetic counsel, we will be better able to
           defend ourselves against the adversary. Just as the
           prophet Alma was able to tell Moroni how to defend
           the Nephites against their enemies, the Lord’s prophets
           today teach us how to defend ourselves against the
           spiritual attacks of the adversary.

                   4. In your scripture study journal, write a few sentences
                   about what prophetic counsel has been given in the latter
           days that, if you heed it, can help you defend yourself from
           Satan’s designs and temptations.
           As recorded in Alma 43:25–43, Moroni acted on the
           knowledge he received from the prophet by dividing
           his army and hiding them along the path of the
           oncoming Lamanites. As the Lamanites approached,
           one half of the Nephite army attacked and drove the                         5. In your scripture study journal, write about a time

                     you think it was important to Moroni to have the                     Read Alma 45:2–7, and identify and mark these

           land. Read Alma 45:16, and consider the following
           truth in this verse: The Lord cannot look upon sin
           with the least degree of allowance.
           To help you understand this principle, remember that
           through His Atonement, the Savior paid the price for
           all our sins if we will repent and seek His forgiveness.
           God cannot tolerate sin in any degree. However,
           because the Savior was willing to suffer in our behalf,
           we do not have to suffer for our sins if we repent.
           Read Doctrine and Covenants 1:31–33. You may want
           to write these verses as a cross-reference near Alma
           45:16.

                 1. Respond to the following question in your scripture
                 study journal: What are your feelings about the Savior
           when you think about His willingness to pay the price for your
           sins?
           As recorded in Alma 45:20–24, Helaman began his
           ministry as the prophet of the Lord and leader of
           the Church. He and other Church leaders appointed
           priests and teachers throughout the congregations, but
           because of contention and increasing pride the people
           refused to listen to their leaders.

           and their religion
           As recorded in Alma 46:1–7, some people who were

           to rally the people in defense of liberty.
           Read Alma 46:12–13, and mark what Moroni wrote                   As recorded in Alma 46:28–37, the Nephites who

           these verses teach you about Moroni’s character. Also            others escaped and joined the Lamanites. Many of

                     enemy, the devil.
                     Alma 47 records the many deceptions that Amalackiah                Alma 48–49
                     used to become king of the Lamanites so that he could

                                                                                        physically and spiritually
                     His ultimate desire was to bring all the Nephites into
                     bondage, with him as their king.                                   While Amalickiah was trying to obtain power by
                                                                                        “fraud and deceit” (Alma 48:7) over the Lamanites
                     Amalackiah and his followers first went to the land                and the Nephites, Moroni was acting in very different
                     of Nephi, where the Lamanites lived. The king of the               ways. Read Alma 48:7–10, and look for what Moroni
                     Lamanites desired to go to battle against the Nephites,            did when he knew that Amalickiah would soon lead
                     but many of his people were afraid. So the king asked              the Lamanite armies against the Nephites. You may
                     Amalackiah to compel the fearful Lamanites to join                 want to mark these ideas: (1) He prepared the people
                     the battle. Amalickiah marched to the mountain refuge              to be faithful to God in times of difficulty (see verse 7).
                     where these people had fled, but he did not want to                (2) He helped the people strengthen areas in which
                     help the king. He wanted to become the leader of the               they were weak (see verses 8–9). (3) He prepared
                     fearful Lamanites by tricking their leader, Lehonti, into          the people to support and defend the “cause of
                     coming down off his mountain refuge. Amalickiah                    Christians,” or the Church (see verse 10).
                     intended to kill Lehonti with poison after he came
                     down.                                                              Just as Moroni helped his people prepare for and

           Throughout the war between the Lamanites and the
           Nephites, both sides had captured many prisoners of

           prisoners. Moroni was happy to exchange prisoners                    in different parts of the land. Helaman sent a letter
           so that the captured Nephites could be returned and                  to Moroni describing his armies’ battles with the
           so that his armies would not have to feed and care for               Lamanites and expressing his confidence and

                  In their first battle against the enemy, the 2,000 young
                  warriors led away the strongest army of the Lamanites,
                  and the Nephite commander Antipus ordered his
                  army to pursue the Lamanite army from behind. The
                  army of Antipus caught up with the Lamanite army,
                  who stopped to fight them. The stripling warriors, who
                  had continued forward, noticed that the Lamanites
                  had stopped pursuing them. They did not know if the
                  Lamanites had halted to trick them into returning so
                  they could be destroyed or if the Lamanites had stopped
                  because Antipus’s army had caught them from behind.
                  Therefore, Helaman did not know if they should turn
                  back and attack the Lamanites. (See Alma 56:29–43.)
                  Read Alma 56:43–48, and look for phrases describing
                  traits these young men demonstrated at a critical time
                  during battle. List what you found in your scripture
                  study journal under the heading “Traits demonstrated
                  during battle.” You might also choose to mark these
                  phrases in your scriptures.
                  Study Alma 56:49, 54–56 to see what happened
                  when the 2,000 young warriors returned to battle the
                  Lamanites. Look for phrases that illustrate this truth:
                  When we act in faith, we can receive strength
                  from God.

                           2. Answer the following questions in your scripture study

                  Helaman and his army were able to take the cities                    c. How would obeying the Lord’s commandments with

                  Alma 59–63
                  Introduction
                  Helaman wrote a letter to Captain Moroni, telling
                  him about the army’s efforts and asking for help
                  from the Nephite government. Captain Moroni
                  rejoiced in learning about Helaman’s successes, but
                  he was angry at the government for neglecting to
                  send reinforcements. Captain Moroni wrote a letter
                  of rebuke to the chief judge, Pahoran. In his reply,
                  Pahoran told of a rebellion against the government.
                  Moroni marched to his aid and defeated the rebels.                 Alma 60–62
                  Then the Nephite armies were able to unitedly defeat               Moroni asks Pahoran about the cause of the government’s
                  the Lamanites. After 14 years of war, the Nephites                 neglect
                  again had peace in the land, allowing Helaman and
                                                                                     After the city of Nephihah was captured by the
                  his brethren to focus on building up the Church.
                                                                                     Lamanites, Captain Moroni decided to write an appeal
                                                                                     to Pahoran, the chief judge in Zarahemla. Read Alma
                  Alma 59                                                            60:17–24, and look for the accusations that Moroni
                  The Nephites lose a stronghold, and Captain Moroni                 made about Pahoran and the people in Zarahemla.
                  grieves because of the wickedness of the people                    Read Alma 60:23 again, and note Captain Moroni’s
                  When Captain Moroni received a letter from Helaman                 reference to cleansing the “inward vessel” first. He
                  describing his army’s successes, Moroni and his                    was referring to the need to remove corruption from
                  people rejoiced. Moroni then sent a letter to Pahoran,             the Nephite government and its people. However, this
                  the Nephite leader in Zarahemla, asking him to                     verse can apply to our lives as well. Imagine putting

                  no reinforcements were sent. Therefore, when the                   the outside of the cup, would you feel comfortable
                  Lamanites attacked the city of Nephihah, the people                drinking from the cup?
                  of Nephihah were forced to flee and the Lamanites
                  conquered the city.                                                       2. Answer the following questions in your scripture study
                                                                                            journal:
                  Read Alma 59:9–12 to learn Moroni’s reaction to the
                  Lamanite victory. Consider marking in your scriptures              a. If we think of ourselves as “vessels,” what do you think it
                  this phrase in Alma 59:9: “it was easier to keep the city          means to cleanse the inner vessel?

                     In your study of the book of Helaman, you will learn      After the chief judge Pahoran died, there was a serious
                     from the examples and teachings of great men such as      contention among the Nephites about which of his
                     Helaman, Nephi, Lehi, and Samuel the Lamanite who         sons—Pahoran, Paanchi, and Pacumeni—should
                     courageously obeyed the Lord and testified of Jesus       become the new chief judge. Pahoran was elected by
                     Christ. The ministries of these individuals demonstrate   the people as the new chief judge. One of Paanchi’s
                     that God grants power to help His servants accomplish     followers, a man named Kishkumen who was acting
                     His will and that the efforts of righteous individuals    for a secret band, murdered Pahoran, and Pacumeni
                     can bring blessings to thousands. You will also           was then appointed as chief judge. Taking advantage
                     learn about the consequences that follow pride,           of this contention and division, the Lamanites were
                     wickedness, and secret combinations.                      able to conquer the Nephites’ capital city of Zarahemla

                     and grandson of Alma the Younger. Helaman received
                     the records from his uncle, Shiblon, and served as a      Helaman 1
                     righteous chief judge over the Nephites. He taught
                     his sons Nephi and Lehi to remember their Redeemer,
                                                                               Contention over who should be chief judge allows the
                     Jesus Christ (see Helaman 5:9–14). These teachings        Lamanites to conquer Zarahemla, the capital city of the
                     later inspired Nephi to give up his position as chief     Nephites
                     judge in order to preach repentance to the Nephites       Think of the last time you had an argument with
                     and Lamanites. After thousands of Lamanites were          someone or witnessed others having an argument.

                            Elder D. Todd Christofferson of the             Mormon understood that people who would have

                     Helaman 13–14
                     Introduction
                     A few years before the Savior’s birth, the Lord sent a
                     Lamanite prophet named Samuel to preach repentance
                     to the Nephites at Zarahemla. The prophet Samuel                     Read Helaman 13:1–8, 11 to understand why Samuel
                     was a second witness of Jesus Christ, along with the                 preached to the Nephites and what the Lord directed
                     prophet Nephi. He forewarned the Nephites of their                   him to say. These verses illustrate the principle:
                     destruction if they did not repent. Samuel confronted                Prophets receive and speak the messages God
                     them about their tendency to reject the prophets and                 puts into their hearts. What message did God put
                     their disposition to seek happiness in doing iniquity.               into Samuel’s heart? According to Helaman 13:7, what
                     He announced the signs that would mark the birth and                 effect did Samuel hope his message would have on the
                     death of Jesus Christ. He also taught that all mankind,              Nephites?
                     through the redemption of Jesus Christ, will be
                     brought back into God’s presence for judgment.
                                                                                                  1. In your scripture study journal, write about a time
                                                                                                  when you felt that a parent or Church leader was inspired
                     Helaman 13                                                           to give a particular message. How did that message affect you?
                     Samuel warns the Nephites of their destruction if they               In the spaces provided, write answers to the questions
                     do not repent                                                        in the following charts as you study Helaman 13:17–23
                     When you have done something wrong and needed                        and Helaman 13:24–30.
                     to be corrected by a parent or other leader, how did
                     you respond?
                     The account of a prophet calling a people to
                     repentance recorded in Helaman 13–16 is unique
                     because it is the first instance in the Book of Mormon
                     of a Lamanite prophet calling Nephites to repentance.

           we need to know, but would rather not hear, is a test                  because of the righteous people who lived among

                     The following are hypothetical situations of two
                     young men:
                     One young man was raised by parents who were not
                     members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
                     Saints and did not emphasize the teachings of Jesus
                     Christ. They allowed their teenage son to drink alcohol,
                     a practice that he continued in college. He later met
                     some Latter-day Saint missionaries. After meeting
                     with the missionaries a few times, he pledged to give
                     up alcohol. A few days later he was with a group of
                     friends. They offered him an alcoholic drink.
                     Another young man was raised in a Latter-day Saint
                     family. His parents held family home evening and
                     family scripture study regularly. He developed a
                     habit of daily scripture study and personal prayer.
                     He attended Primary, served in Aaronic Priesthood
                     quorums, and graduated from seminary. He knew
                     and understood the gospel of Jesus Christ and God’s
                     commandments. While attending college he developed
                     new friendships. One night some friends offered him
                     an alcoholic drink.
                     Consider the level of spiritual strength that might be
                     expected from each of these two young men in their

               is named for Nephi, the son of Nephi, whose labors
                                                                           had to decide if they were willing to give up their lives

               3 Nephi. While making his abridgment of Nephi’s             situation the faithful Nephites faced. How would you
               record, Mormon also added his own commentary                feel if you were Nephi and the time had arrived when
               and testimony to this book (see 3 Nephi 5:8–26;             the believers were about to be destroyed? Ponder for
               26:6–12; 29–30).                                            a moment why some people might struggle to remain

               3 Nephi were likely written between 1 B.C. and 34 B.C.      Nephi in 3 Nephi 1:13–14. You may want to mark the
               Mormon abridged those records sometime between              statement in 3 Nephi 1:13 that indicates this principle:
               A.D. 345 and A.D. 385. Mormon did not record where          The Lord will fulfill all the words that He has
               he was when he compiled this book.                          caused to be spoken by His prophets.

           our hearts.

                     After the people who were at the temple in the land of
                     Bountiful had individually felt the marks of the wounds
                     in Jesus Christ’s side, hands, and feet, the Savior gave
                     Nephi and others power to baptize. The Savior warned
                     the people to avoid contention and promised that
                     those who live the gospel will inherit the kingdom of
                     God. He also taught them how to receive the blessings
                     of His gospel and instructed them to influence others
                     for good. The Savior declared that He had fulfilled the
                     law of Moses, and He gave the people a higher law to
                     prepare them to become like Him and our Father in
                     Heaven.

                     Jesus Christ gives Nephi and others the power to baptize
                     and denounces contention
                     Do you recall your thoughts and feelings as you
                     prepared for your baptism, or have you watched a friend
                     or family member prepare to be baptized? Many people
                     have questions like “Who can baptize me?” and “How
                     is the ordinance of baptism performed?” Consider how
                     you would answer those questions.
                     While studying 3 Nephi 11:1–17, you learned about
                     Jesus Christ’s appearance to “the people of Nephi,

                     sometimes referred to as the “sermon at the temple”                  example or light to the world (see 3 Nephi 12:14–16).
                     because they resemble and often increase our
                     understanding of the Savior’s well-known Sermon                      3 Nephi 12:17–48
                     on the Mount (see Matthew 5–7). President Harold B.

                     be ‘an autobiography, every syllable of which he had                 Him by repenting and obeying His commandments
                     written down in deeds,’ and in so doing has given us                 (see 3 Nephi 12:19–20). In the remainder of

                     As in the Sermon on the Mount, the Savior began

                     declarations of the blessed and joyful condition of those
                     who are faithful (see 3 Nephi 12:1–12). As you read
                     them, look for which attributes the Savior urges us to                      5. Read the following scripture references, and write in

                     our doing so. As you read, you may want to mark these
                     attributes and promised blessings. It might be helpful               a. 3 Nephi 12:21–22. It may be helpful to understand that the
                     to know that poor in spirit (3 Nephi 12:3) means to be               word raca is a derogatory term expressing contempt, open

                     12:4) refers to feeling a sorrow for our sins that leads to          b. 3 Nephi 12:23–24. Use footnote 24a to help discover what

                     be humble and gentle, to be submissive to God’s will,                c. 3 Nephi 12:25. It may be helpful to understand that to “agree
                     or to be patient in enduring injury without resentment.              with thine adversary quickly” refers to resolving conflicts with

                  3 Nephi 14. He taught the people about judging others            whenever we proclaim that any particular person is

                  Father through prayer. The Savior also warned against            a particular time. When we do this—and there is great
                  false prophets and emphasized the importance of                  temptation to do so—we hurt ourselves and the person

                     Introduction
                     As the Savior continued teaching the people at the
                     temple in the land of Bountiful, He declared that the
                     law of Moses was fulfilled in Him and that He was
                     the light and law that the people should look to. The
                     Savior then explained to the twelve Nephite disciples
                     that the people in the Americas were some of the
                     “other sheep” of whom He spoke to the people at
                     Jerusalem (see John 10:14–16). He also promised
                     that those who repent and return to Him will be

                     The Savior declares that He has fulfilled the law of Moses
                     Have you ever wondered why the Lord asks us to
                     obey certain laws and commandments, such as paying
                     tithing, observing the Sabbath day, or honoring our
                     parents? As Jesus Christ continued to instruct the
                     Nephites, He taught them the central purpose behind
                     His laws and commandments. Watch for this purpose
                     as you study 3 Nephi 15.
                     As the Savior finished speaking to the multitude, He         response that might have reassured the Nephites that
                     perceived that some among them had a question.               the source of the law was not changing.
                     Read 3 Nephi 15:1–2, and write what the people were
                     marveling and wondering about:                                      1. Answer the following question in your scripture study
                                                                                         journal: What do you think Jesus was teaching the
                                                                                  Nephites when He said, “I am the law”? (3 Nephi 15:9).
                     To understand why the Nephites were marveling and
                     wondering at the Savior’s declaration that the “old          From the Savior’s teachings in these verses, we can
                     things” of the law of Moses had passed away and              learn that Jesus Christ is the object of all the laws
                     “all things had become new,” it helps to understand          and commandments of the gospel. Ponder why this
                     that for centuries the Nephites had known and lived          truth would have been important to the Nephites as
                     under the law of Moses. Their laws, rites, and church        they learned that the old law of Moses was replaced
                     organization were based on the Mosaic law, which             with the higher law and experienced changes in their
                     law was given anciently by the premortal Jesus Christ        manner of worship.
                     to prepare people for His coming and point them to           Read 3 Nephi 15:9–10, and mark what the Lord wants
                     His atoning sacrifice. Now the Divine Lawgiver was           us to do as a result of this doctrine. Use what you learn
                     standing before them declaring that the Atonement            in these verses to complete the following principle:
                     had been accomplished (see 3 Nephi 11:10–14) and             If we -------------------- to Jesus Christ through

                     things were to take the law’s place suddenly changed                2. Think about commandments such as paying tithing,
                     how they were to worship God.                                       observing the Sabbath day, and honoring our parents, and
                     The Savior responded to their concerns by                    answer the following questions in your scripture study journal:

                        if we look to our Savior Jesus Christ                Gentiles would not “hear” the Savior’s voice (see

           sheep
           Have you ever felt forgotten or alone and wondered if
           Heavenly Father knew who you were? Although we
           may feel alone or sometimes feel less important than
           others, God cares for His people and manifests
           Himself to them. Watch for evidence of this truth as
           you study the rest of 3 Nephi 15 and the beginning of
           3 Nephi 16.
           As recorded in the New Testament and the Book of
           Mormon, Jesus Christ ministered among the people
           in the Old World and in the Americas. Read 3 Nephi
           15:11–17 looking for what the Lord said He told those
           in Jerusalem about His people in the Americas.
           “Other sheep” is a reference to other followers of
           the Shepherd, Jesus Christ. A fold is a sheep pen,
           but the word fold is used in this instance to mean a
           group of people with a common belief in Jesus Christ.
           According to 3 Nephi 15:17, how did the Lord say He
           would manifest Himself to His other sheep?
           Jesus explained why Heavenly Father commanded
           Him not to give more knowledge of His other sheep
           to those in Jerusalem. Search 3 Nephi 15:18–20, and

                     of Jesus Christ and His gospel.

                     gift of the Holy Ghost and lives worthy of it. Then compare your
                     list with the following quotation by Elder Robert D. Hales of the
                     Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and add to your list any new
                     ideas you find:

                                    of the Father and the Son. . . .

                     decisions that confront us daily. Our young men and women are
                     bombarded with ugly things of the world. Companionship with
                     the Spirit will give them the strength to resist evil and, when
                     necessary, repent and return to the strait and narrow path. None
                     of us are immune from the temptations of the adversary. We
                     all need the fortification available through the Holy Ghost. . . .
                     Having the gift of the Holy Ghost helps family members make
                     wise choices—choices that will help them return with their
                     families to their Father in Heaven and His Son, Jesus Christ, to
                     live with Them eternally” (“The Covenant of Baptism: To Be in
                     the Kingdom and of the Kingdom,” Ensign, Nov. 2000, 8).

           Although the Lord’s people had strayed from the
           ordinances and covenants of the gospel, notice the
           promise in 3 Nephi 24:7, which the Lord gave them if
           they would return unto Him. You may want to mark this

           we return unto the Lord, He will return unto us.
           Read 3 Nephi 24:8–10, and look for one way that the
           Lord indicated the sons of Jacob could return to Him

                     Jesus Christ revealed                                                them that the Atonement is the essence of His gospel

                     We learn from 3 Nephi 26:3 that the Savior taught the
                                                                                          spotless before Him as we repent, are baptized, and
                     Nephites “all things which should come upon the face

                     much of the Savior’s sermon was recorded in the Book
                     of Mormon. Study 3 Nephi 26:9–11 to find out why
                     Mormon did not include everything.                                   3 Nephi 27:1–12
                     The Lord directed Mormon to include only a small                     The Lord teaches the twelve disciples that His Church
                     portion of those teachings in order to try our faith.                should bear His name
                     From 3 Nephi 26:1–21 we learn that as we believe                     Imagine that you wanted to start a new club or sports
                     what God has revealed, we prepare ourselves                          team. Decide what type of club or team you would
                     to receive greater revelation. Why do you think                      create, and then choose a name for your organization.
                     believing the truths we have already received is                     Write down both the name and the kind of
                     essential before we receive additional truth? (See                   organization you chose:
                     Alma 12:9–11.) How can we show that we believe
                     what the Lord has revealed?
                                                                                          Think about some organizations you know about and

                     are you doing in your life to demonstrate your belief in the Book
                     of Mormon?                                                           The twelve Nephite disciples continued to teach and

           something you knew was wrong. Recall how you felt
           when the truth about what you had done became
           known. Ponder the following questions: How would
           you feel standing before the Lord to be judged if there
           were still some wrong deeds you had not repented of?
           How would you feel standing before the Lord to be
           judged if there was no way to repent of any of the sins
           you committed during your life?
           After teaching the Nephites that His Church must be
           built upon His gospel, the Savior went on to teach
           them what His gospel is. The word gospel literally                Have you ever heard someone say that we need to

                     Jesus Christ instructs His disciples to be like He is
                     As recorded at the end of 3 Nephi 27, Jesus Christ gave
                     instructions to His twelve disciples and taught them
                     about their role as leaders and judges of their people.

                     He gave the disciples to help them righteously fulfill

                     Why Study This Book?                                      Introduction
                     As you study the book of Mormon, you will learn           Although Mormon grew up in a time of great
                     valuable lessons from Mormon, who lived faithfully        wickedness, he chose to be faithful. Because of his
                     as a disciple of Jesus Christ even though he was          faithfulness, he was called to care for the records of
                     surrounded throughout his life by “a continual scene      the Nephites. When he was 15 years old, Mormon
                     of wickedness and abominations” (Mormon 2:18).            was “visited of the Lord, and tasted and knew of the
                     You will also benefit from studying the words of          goodness of Jesus” (Mormon 1:15). In the same year,
                     Moroni, Mormon’s son, who testified to latter-day         the Nephites appointed him to lead their armies (see
                     readers, “Jesus Christ hath shown you unto me, and I      Mormon 2:1). He desired to help the Nephites repent,
                     know your doing” (Mormon 8:35). By studying these         but because of their willful rebellion, he was forbidden

                     Who Wrote This Book?
                     Mormon wrote the first seven chapters of this book
                     as a brief account of the wickedness and wars among
                                                                               Mormon 1:1–5
                     the Nephites and Lamanites in his day. He also made       Mormon is given charge of the sacred records
                     “a full account” of events from his lifetime upon the     What are some words you would like people to use
                     large plates of Nephi. (See Mormon 2:18; 5:9.) When       when they describe you?
                     Mormon was “about ten years of age,” the record

                     would have the responsibility to record “all the things

                     that [he] observed concerning this people” (Mormon
                                                                               a Mormon?
                     1:2, 4). At about age 24, he gained custody of the
                     plates of Nephi and made “a record according to the       President Gordon B. Hinckley spoke about the
                     words of Ammaron” (Mormon 2:17). Later, Mormon            nickname Mormon, which some people use when

                     from Lehi through Ammaron. Near the end of his life,

                     record” refers to the Book of Mormon, and “the record               bottom of the pages in Mormon 7 and 8. How many
                     which shall come unto the Gentiles from the Jews” refers            years passed between the time Mormon wrote his last
                     to the Bible. Similarly, “this” in Mormon 7:9 refers to the         words in chapter 7 and when Moroni began to write

                     Introduction
                     After writing about the destruction of his people
                     and the death of his father, Moroni prophesied of the
                     coming forth of the Book of Mormon and warned those
                     who would condemn it. Moroni saw that the Nephite
                     record would come forth in a day of great wickedness,
                     when many would love worldly possessions more than                   Look again at Mormon 8:12–14 to identify what Moroni

                     dangerous conditions of the last days.                               Moroni explained that while the Lord would not allow
                                                                                          the plates to be used for financial gain, the writings

                     Think of a time when you noticed someone in need—

                     don’t help those in need?                                            God through repentance. He taught that God is a God

                     Moroni gave for why some people in the last days                     miracles cease only when people stop having faith. He
                     will not help those in need. Consider marking                        encouraged all mankind to pray to the Father in the

                    1. Answer the following question in your scripture study
                    journal: Why do you think it is wrong to wait to repent in
           this life, believing you can repent in the next life? (You may want
           to use what you learn from Mormon 9:1–5; Alma 12:14; and
           Alma 34:32–34 in your answer.)
           Read Mormon 9:6, and look for what the
           “unbelieving” must do to avoid the anguish Moroni
           described. Consider marking the words in Mormon 9:6
           that describe the condition of people who turn to God
           and ask Him for forgiveness. From this verse we learn:
           If we will repent and call upon God, we will be
           spotless when we come into His presence. You may
           want to write this principle in your scriptures or your
           scripture study journal.

                   2. In your scripture study journal, write a few sentences
                   about how you imagine you would feel in God’s presence
           if you knew you had been made pure and spotless through the
           Savior’s Atonement.
           Through repentance and righteous living, you can                      so that he could help people believe that God still
           prepare to be comfortable in God’s presence. Ponder                   works miracles.
           the most important thing you feel you could do now
           to be prepared to meet God.                                                    3. In your scripture study journal, write what you
                                                                                          learned from Mormon 9:9–11, 15–19 about God’s nature.
                                                                                 Also write your answer to this question: What do these verses
           Mormon 9:7–20                                                         teach you about God’s willingness and ability to perform miracles

           Have you ever witnessed or experienced a miracle?                     people may not experience miracles.
           Write your definition of the word miracle:
                                                                                 Moroni’s words recorded in Mormon 9:9–19 teach this
                                                                                 principle: Because God is unchangeable, He will
                                                                                 provide miracles according to His children’s faith.
           Look up the word miracle in the Bible Dictionary or                   You may want to write this principle next to Mormon

           definition. Why do you think some people today do
           not believe in miracles?                                              We can experience God’s miraculous power in many
                                                                                 ways in our lives. After reviewing some of the great
           As recorded in Mormon 9:7–8, Moroni wrote to people                   miracles described in the scriptures, Sister Sydney S.
           in the last days who would deny that God lives, that He               Reynolds, who served in the Primary general
           gives revelations, and that He pours out gifts upon the               presidency, taught:
           faithful. Moroni taught powerfully that there is a God
           and that He is the same “yesterday, today, and forever”               “Just as important as these ‘mighty miracles’ are the
           (Mormon 9:9). He continues to work miracles among                     smaller ‘private miracles’ that teach each of us to have

                     Moroni teaches about prayer and about the purpose of the            Additional questions, thoughts, and insights I would like to share
                     Nephite record                                                      with my teacher:
                     Can you recall a time when you felt that Heavenly
                     Father gave you the help you needed because you had
                     prayed? Read Mormon 9:21, and look for what Moroni
                     taught about praying to Heavenly Father for help.
                     Read the following statement, and look for what it
                     means to pray in the name of Christ: “We pray in
                     Christ’s name when our mind is the mind of Christ,
                     and our wishes the wishes of Christ—when his
                     words abide in us (John 15:7). We then ask for things
                     it is possible for God to grant. Many prayers remain
                     unanswered because they are not in Christ’s name at
                     all; they in no way represent his mind, but spring out
                     of the selfishness of man’s heart” (Bible Dictionary,
                     “Prayer”).
                     Consider your own prayers based on what you just
                     read. What can you do to more fully pray in the name
                     of Jesus Christ?
                     To provide an example of people who believed in the
                     Savior and were able to work miracles, Moroni quoted
                     what Jesus Christ taught His Nephite disciples. As
                     recorded in Mormon 9:22–25, the Savior commanded
                     His disciples to go into all the world and preach the
                     gospel, and He promised that miraculous “signs shall
                     follow them that believe” (Mormon 9:24). Moroni then
                     continued his teachings about prayer.

                             5. Read Mormon 9:27–29, and identify what Moroni
                             taught about how we should pray in faith. Write the
                     things you identify in your scripture study journal. Then write a
                     few sentences describing how you can use one of these

               Why Study This Book?                                        Introduction
               As you study the book of Ether, you will learn about        The book of Ether is Moroni’s abridgment of the
               the Jaredites—a group of people who traveled to             history of the Jaredites. The Jaredites were people who
               the Western Hemisphere and lived there for many             came to the Western Hemisphere centuries before the
               centuries before the arrival of the people of Lehi.         people of Lehi. Following the Flood in Noah’s day,
               This book will help you learn important principles          many descendants of those who had been spared
               concerning prayer, revelation, and the relationship         became wicked. One group of people attempted to

               spiritual knowledge. It will also help you understand       (Genesis 11:4). The account of the Jaredite nation
               the role of prophets in persuading people to repent         began with the building of the Tower of Babel. The
               and the consequences that come to those who reject          Lord dealt with the widespread wickedness by
               Jesus Christ and His prophets.                              confounding the common language and by scattering
                                                                           the people across the face of the earth (see Genesis
               Who Wrote This Book?                                        11:5–8; Ether 1:33). This account in the book of Ether
               Moroni abridged this book from 24 gold plates called        begins with Jared and his brother seeking the Lord’s
               the plates of Ether. It is named for the prophet Ether,     help when He confounded the language of the people
               who was the last prophet of the Jaredites and created a     at the Tower of Babel. The Lord preserved the language
               record of their history (see Ether 15:33–34). In the days   of Jared, his brother, and their families and friends and
               of King Mosiah, some of the people of Limhi discovered      led them through the wilderness toward the promised
               the plates of Ether as they were searching for the land     land. The Lord then instructed the brother of Jared to
               of Zarahemla (see Mosiah 8:7–11; Ether 1:2). Nephite        build eight barges to carry his people over the seas.
               prophets and record keepers passed the plates of Ether
               down until they came into Moroni’s possession. Moroni
               stated that he did not include “the hundredth part” of
               the record in his abridgment (Ether 15:33).

               When and Where Was It Written?
               The original sources used to create the book of
               Ether were written centuries before Moroni made his
               abridgment. The first Jaredite record was created when
               the brother of Jared wrote the vision he received before
               his people crossed the seas (see Ether 4:1). No other
               record keepers among the Jaredites are mentioned until
               Ether (see Ether 13:3; 15:33). Moroni abridged the book
               of Ether (see Mormon 8:3–6; Moroni 10:1). Moroni did
               not state where he was when he made the abridgment,
               although he wrote that the Jaredites were destroyed in
               “this north country” (Ether 1:1), indicating he may have
                                                                           Ether 1:1–33
               been in the land where they were destroyed.                 Moroni records the genealogy of Ether back to Jared at the
                                                                           Tower of Babel
                                                                           To help you understand where the book of Ether came
                                                                           from, review “Overview of Mosiah 7–24” from the

                     the brief description of the book under the title. This       Lord gave to the Jaredites to guide them in their journey.

                     taken from 24 gold plates found by the people of Limhi.       brother to follow these instructions from the Lord?
                     After Moroni finished the record of his father, he took
                     the Jaredites’ record and created a shorter version of it     Ether 2:1–12
                     to include in the Book of Mormon. Read Ether 1:1–4,           The Jaredites begin their journey toward the promised land
                     and look for what Moroni said he did not include in his
                                                                                   Read Ether 2:1–3 to discover how well the Jaredites
                     version of the Jaredite record. Then read Ether 1:5, and
                                                                                   responded to the instructions the Lord gave them
                     look for what part of the account Moroni did include
                                                                                   about preparing to travel to a promised land (see
                     in his record. The tower referred to in Ether 1:5 is the
                                                                                   Ether 1:41–42). Then read Ether 2:4–6, and look
                     Tower of Babel. As explained in Ether 1:33, the Lord
                                                                                   for what happened next. Notice that because the
                     “confounded” (confused or mixed up) the language
                                                                                   Jaredites had obeyed the Lord’s instructions, He gave

                     the people throughout the earth.

                     As recorded in Ether 1:6–33, a man named Ether

                                                                                   As we act in faith on direction the Lord has given
                     ancestry of Ether back to a man named Jared, who
                                                                                   us, we can receive further guidance from Him. You

                     The brother of Jared prays for help, and his family members   have received from the Lord while praying, studying

                     Jared wanted to be able to communicate. After the             hard, it results in significant personal growth” (“Using

                     Ether 1:34–35), he prayed for his friends (see Ether
                     1:36–37). As demonstrated by the brother of Jared,                   1. Write in your scripture study journal how you

                     confounded. Then Jared asked his brother to pray to           of Jared that when he and his people arrived in the
                     God, asking Him where their families should go. (See          promised land, they would need to “serve him, the true

           Ether 2:13–15
           The Lord chastens the brother of Jared for not calling upon
           Him in prayer
           Read Ether 2:13–15, and look for what happened when
           the Jaredites came to the great sea that divided the
           lands. They had been guided through the wilderness
           by the Lord because they listened to the Lord and kept
           His commandments. However, after they had camped
           by the great sea for four years, the Lord came to the
           brother of Jared and chastised him for failing to pray.
           Ether 2:14–15 helps us learn these principles: The
           Lord is not pleased when we fail to call upon
           Him in prayer. The Lord desires us to call upon
           Him regularly in prayer.
           As you read the following statement from Elder
           Donald L. Staheli, who served as a member of the
           Seventy, think about how often you pray: “Daily
           fervent prayers seeking forgiveness and special
           help and direction are essential to our lives and
           the nourishment of our testimonies. When we                   a difficult family or social situation, how to do well in
           become hurried, repetitive, casual, or forgetful in our       school, whom to marry, or what profession to pursue.
           prayers, we tend to lose the closeness of the Spirit,         Have you thought about how the Lord might give
           which is so essential in the continual direction we           you direction or help in that situation? As you study
           need to successfully manage the challenges of our             the remainder of Ether 2, ponder the decision you
           everyday lives” (“Securing Our Testimonies” Ensign            identified and look for principles that will help you

           In your personal journal or on a separate piece of            Read Ether 2:16–17, and look for what the Lord asked

                     us from receiving further revelation. Read Ether 4:8,                verses that is directed to the Prophet Joseph Smith—
                     and mark what would cause the Lord to hold back                      the person who would one day translate the record
                     revelation and “show no greater things.”                             on the plates? Imagine what it may have been like

                     of the Lord”? (Ether 4:8).
                     b. What are some ways a young person today might “contend
                     against the word of the Lord”?
                     Moroni included the Lord’s own words to describe
                     how to receive additional revelation from Him. Search
                     Ether 4:11, 13–15, and mark phrases that teach what
                     we must do to invite the Lord’s revelation and how
                     He will respond if we do these things.
                     What principles concerning revelation and how to
                     invite it into your life do you learn from these verses?

                     these verses in your scriptures next to Ether 4:11.
                     One important principle we can learn from the Lord’s
                     counsel is that as we exercise great faith in the word
                     of the Lord, He will, in His own due time and way,
                     bless us with further revelation.

                            you need to show faith in the word of God you have
                     already received before the Lord will reveal more to you. Then
                     rate yourself on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being “very effective”) on
                     how well you feel you are exercising faith in the Lord by seeking
                     for and following His word in each of the following areas:
                     a. Daily prayer

                  journey finally came to an end. Read Ether 6:12,

                  your parents and others encouraged you to walk
                  humbly before the Lord? What do you think is the
                  relationship between walking humbly and being
                  taught from on high? When have you felt you were
                  “taught from on high”? (Ether 6:17).

                     One of the truths you may have identified in these

                            when you or someone you know has received a witness

                     As recorded in Ether 13:23–14:20, Coriantumr fought
                     battles with several men who tried to take the kingdom
                     from him, including Shared, Gilead, and Lib. Eventually,
                     the entire Jaredite nation became engulfed in war.
                     Coriantumr’s final enemy was a man named Shiz. The
                     extent of the destruction among the Jaredites from these
                     wars is detailed in Ether 14:21–25 and Ether 15:1–2.
                     Read Ether 15:3–6 to discover what Coriantumr
                     attempted to do to spare the remainder of the people
                     from destruction. Think about why Shiz rejected
                     Coriantumr’s proposal and why the people in both
                     armies refused to surrender (see also Ether 14:24).
                     Read Ether 15:12–17, and look for details about the
                     Jaredites’ situation. What do you find particularly
                     tragic or sorrowful about their condition? Remember
                     that Ether had spent many years warning the people                                    Reflect upon the following statement
                     to repent (see Ether 12:2–3; 13:20). Read Ether                                       from Elder Neil L. Andersen of the

                     from rejecting the Lord’s warnings to repent. Based                                   that the Savior is able and eager to forgive
                     on what you read, complete this statement: If we                                      our sins. Except for the sins of those few
                     reject the Lord’s warnings to repent, then                                            who choose perdition after having known

                     In the space above, you may have written a principle                    one of the sweetest fruits of the gospel, removing guilt
                     such as the following: If we reject the Lord’s                          and pain from our hearts and replacing them with joy
                     warnings to repent, His Spirit withdraws and                            and peace of conscience” (“Repent . . . That I May Heal

                     sacrament prayers, either for the bread or for the water.
                     b. After reviewing these sacred prayers (see Moroni 4:3; 5:2)
                     and checking what you wrote in the first part of this assignment,
                     write about a part of one of the sacrament prayers that stands

                     meaningful to you.
                     Moroni included the prayers for the administration of
                     the sacrament in his record because he felt they would
                     be “of worth” to people “in some future day” (Moroni
                     1:4). Read Moroni 4:1–3 and 5:1–2, and identify phrases              3.
                     that explain what the sacramental bread and water
                     represent. As you read, it may be helpful to remember
                     that today the Church uses water in the sacrament
                     instead of wine as a result of a revelation given to the
                     Prophet Joseph Smith (see D&C 27:2).

           to “keep [you] in the right way”? (Moroni 6:4).
           Read Moroni 6:7–8, and look for what the members                 Moroni 7:1–10
           of the Church in Moroni’s day were “strict to observe,”          Mormon teaches the followers of Jesus Christ about works

           encourage each other to avoid and repent of sin?                 good on the inside as it appeared on the outside? One

           forgiveness with real intent, we will be forgiven. You
           may wish to mark this truth in Moroni 6:8.
           Moroni concluded this chapter by teaching how our
           Church meetings should be conducted. Read Moroni
           6:9, and identify who should guide our meetings in the
           Church. Think of a time when you were particularly
           aware of the influence of the Holy Ghost during a
           Church meeting.
           How can the principle that Church meetings are to be
           conducted by the power of the Holy Ghost apply to
           you? If you were asked to give a talk or teach a lesson
           during a Church meeting, how could you help ensure

           One principle we learn from Moroni 7:40–42 is: If we               never fails and the reason charity is greater than even
           exercise faith in Jesus Christ, we can obtain a hope               the most significant acts of goodness he cited is that
           through the Atonement of Jesus Christ to be raised                 charity, ‘the pure love of Christ’ (Moro. 7:47), is not an
           to eternal life.                                                   act but a condition or state of being. Charity is attained
                                                                              through a succession of acts that result in a conversion.
           Read Moroni 7:43, and identify characteristics that are
                                                                              Charity is something one becomes. Thus, as Moroni
           required in order for a person to have the faith and
                                                                              declared, ‘except men shall have charity they cannot
           hope that Mormon spoke of.
                                                                              inherit’ the place prepared for them in the mansions
           To be “meek, and lowly of heart” means to be truly                 of the Father (Ether 12:34; emphasis added)” (“The
           humble, gentle, and submissive to the Lord’s will.                 Challenge to Become,” Ensign, Nov. 2000, 34.)

           are necessary in order to have faith and hope in the

                  In the beginning of the Book of Mormon, Nephi
                  declared that through his writings he would show us
                  examples of the Lord’s tender mercy (see 1 Nephi 1:20).
                  At the end of the Book of Mormon, Moroni asked us
                  to remember the mercies of the Lord to us (see Moroni
                  10:3). You might want to write the cross-reference

                  Remembering the mercy of the Lord to others and
                  ourselves can prepare us to ponder the Book of
                  Mormon’s message for us.

                  “Ponder it in your hearts”
                  The next step Moroni taught is to “ponder it in your
                  hearts.” Elder Marvin J. Ashton of the Quorum of the
                  Twelve Apostles explained how pondering can help us                 “Ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith
                  receive the Holy Ghost in our lives:                                in Christ”
                                “As I study the scriptures, I am challenged           When people “pray sincerely and have real intent,”

                  1. Think about spiritual gifts you have received from
                  God, and then answer two or all of the following
           questions in your scripture study journal:
           a. How have you profited from gifts of the Spirit you have
           received?
           b. What examples of spiritual gifts have you seen in the
           Church today?
           c. How can you use your spiritual gifts to bless the lives of
           others? How has your life been blessed by the gifts of others?
           Consider how spiritual gifts were apparent in the
           coming forth of the Book of Mormon. In the spaces
           provided, identify the spiritual gifts that were noticeable
           in the life of Joseph Smith, as shown in each picture:

                     Moroni testified that we must have faith in order to                As President Faust taught, perfection is a goal we can
                     receive spiritual gifts. He taught that God “worketh                work toward now and achieve in the life to come, with
                     by power, according to the faith of the children of                 the Savior’s help. Moroni concluded his testimony
                     men, the same today and tomorrow, and forever”                      by teaching what we can do to invite the Savior’s
                     (Moroni 10:7). Read Moroni 10:19, 24, and identify                  purifying power into our lives now and ultimately
                     what prevents people from receiving and recognizing                 become perfected through His Atonement.
                     spiritual gifts.
                                                                                                5. Make the following chart in your scripture study
                             2. Write in your scripture study journal why you think             journal:
                             people in a condition of unbelief cannot recognize or
                     receive the power and gifts of God.                                  What I can do                   What God promises
                     Read Moroni 10:20–23. Look for what Moroni taught
                     about the important spiritual gifts of faith, hope, and
                     charity. He testified that the spiritual gift of faith leads
                     to a wonderful blessing. Look at verse 23 to find this
                     blessing. Note that the word expedient means “desirable,”
                     and the phrase “all things which are expedient unto me”
                     can mean “all things that I desire you to do.” You may
                     want to mark the sentence in Moroni 10:23 that teaches              Search Moroni 10:30–33, looking for (a) what we must do to
                     this principle: If we have faith, we will be able to do             become pure and eventually perfect and (b) what God promises
                     what Heavenly Father wants us to do.                                to do to help us. Record what you find in the appropriate column

                     in your scripture study journal in response to one or both of       to Moroni 10:32–33: As we come unto Jesus Christ,
                     the following statements:                                           we can be purified and perfected through His

                             4. Think about the two principles you have learned in       with believing in Him and then humbly seeking His

           wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our
           iniquities, the Lamb who was despised and afflicted,

           Review Moroni 10:32–33, and mark phrases
           emphasizing that the only way we can be perfect is to
           be perfect “in Christ.” This means that we cannot reach
           perfection by ourselves; we must rely on the power
           and grace of the Savior’s Atonement. Ponder why we
           need the Atonement of Jesus Christ to become pure
           and perfect. You may want to mark phrases in Moroni
           10:32–33 that you find encouraging as you strive for
           purity and the eternal goal of perfection.
           Look back at what you wrote under “What I can do”
           in the chart in your scripture study journal. Select one
           action written there and ponder how you can be more
           diligent in that area in your life.
           Read Moroni 10:34, and look for evidence of Moroni’s
           faith in Jesus Christ and hope of receiving eternal life.
           We too can have faith and hope as we make the study
           of the Book of Mormon a lifetime pursuit and apply
           the truths taught in its pages.

                   6. In concluding this course of study on the Book of
                   Mormon, answer the following questions in your scripture
           study journal, and be prepared to share your answers with your
           teacher:
           a. What difference has studying the Book of Mormon this year
           made in your life?
           b. What lessons or principles have helped you “come unto
           Christ” and strengthened your faith in the Savior?
            c. What is your testimony of the Book of Mormon?

                     7. Write the following at the bottom of today’s
