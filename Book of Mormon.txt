Introduction to

the Home-Study Seminary Program

The home-study seminary program is designed to help you
strengthen your understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ
and apply its teachings in your daily life through a study of
the scriptures. For your study this school year, you will first
complete reading assignments from the scripture text for this
course—the Book of Mormon—and then you will complete
the individual lessons. Once a week you will meet with a
seminary teacher to submit your work and participate in a
weekly lesson.

Seminary is a daily religious education program. Prayerfully
studying your scriptures should be a daily practice. You will
need to work on your seminary assignments each school
day, even though you will not attend a seminary class each
day. There are 32 units to be completed during the course.
The reading chart on page viii shows what you should study
for each unit. Your teacher will help you understand when
each unit is due. The lessons in this study guide should each
take about 30 minutes to complete, in addition to your daily
scripture study.

You should have two scripture study journals (or two
notebooks), separate from your personal journal, in which

you will write the assignments from the study guide
activities. Each week that you meet with your teacher, you
should turn in the scripture study journal containing the
completed assignments from the study guide activities you
completed for that week. Your teacher will read and respond
to the assignments and return that scripture study journal to
you the following week. You could also write your responses
on paper in a loose-leaf binder and turn in the pages you did
that week. Then, when your teacher returns the pages, you
could put them back into the notebook.

Using This Manual in a Daily
Seminary Program

This manual may be used by teachers and students in a
daily seminary program to enhance lessons or for make-up
work. However, it is not intended to be given to every daily
seminary student. If a student needs to make up a lesson
for credit, the teacher may assign him or her to complete
the home-study lesson that corresponds with the lesson
that was missed.

Introduction

The Lord commanded Lehi to send his sons back to
Jerusalem to obtain the plates of brass from Laban.
While Laman and Lemuel did not see how they would
fulfill this command, Nephi had faith that the Lord
would provide a way to accomplish what He required.
Despite repeated difficulties, Nephi faithfully persisted
in doing what the Lord had asked. As a result, he

was led by the Holy Spirit and successfully obtained
the plates. Nephi’s experience shows that persistent
obedience qualifies us for the Lord’s help in difficult
situations.

1 Nephi 3:1-9, 19-20

Lehi’s sons return to Jerusalem

tice the difference in how Laman and Lemuel
responded to the Lord’s command as opposed to
Nephi’s response.

To understand the difficulty of what the Lord
commanded, it is helpful to know that the distance
from Jerusalem to the Red Sea (the Gulf of Aqaba) is
about 180 miles through hot, barren country infested
by many thieves. Lehi and his family had traveled
three days’ journey beyond this point (see 1 Nephi
2:5-6), and now the Lord was saying his sons were to
go back to Jerusalem. Read 1 Nephi 3:7-8, and identify

the reason Nephi gave for his willingness to obey
the Lord’s command.

Nephi testified of the principle that if we will do
what the Lord commands, then He will prepare
a way for us to accomplish it. As you continue to
study 1 Nephi 3, think about how Nephi’s example
of courage and determination can inspire you to be
more obedient and show greater faith in the Lord.
Pay particular attention to how Nephi responded to
difficulties. Even though Nephi would face adversity
as he and his brothers tried to obtain the plates of
brass, he chose not to murmur (see 1 Nephi 3:6).

The plates of brass contained “the record of the

Jews” (1 Nephi 3:3), which were their scriptures.

They contained some of the writings and information.
currently found in the Old Testament as well as other
prophetic writings. Read 1 Nephi 3:19-20, and underline
what the plates of brass contained that made them so
important to Lehi‘s family and descendants.

COO Scripture Mastery—1 Nephi 3:7

Read 1 Nephi 3:7 three times (you may wish to vary
how you read it: out loud or silently). Close your
scriptures, and try to write answers to the following
questions without looking at the verse:

e Who was Nephi speaking to?

e What did Nephi commit to do?

e What did Nephi know the Lord would do?

Open your scriptures, and review 1 Nephi 3:7 and your
answers.

The Prophet Joseph Smith said: “I made this my

rule: When the Lord commands, do it” (in History of the
Church, 2:170). Consider writing this statement in your
scriptures next to 1 Nephi 3:7.

1 Nephi 3:10-31
Laban steals Lehi’s property and tries to kill Nephi and
his brothers

God blesses us in different ways as we obey His
commandments. Nephi’s experience in obtaining

the brass plates supports his testimony that God

does provide a way for His children to fulfill His
commandments (see 1 Nephi 3:7). Use the following
chart to study the first two attempts of Lehi’s sons

to obtain the brass plates. Write the answer to the
questions in the column for each attempt, or you may
complete this assignment in your scripture study journal.

“., Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children
in love and righteousness, to provide for their physical
and spiritual needs, and to teach them to love and
serve one another, observe the commandments of
God, and be law-abiding citizens wherever they live.
Husbands and wives—mothers and fathers—will be
held accountable before God for the discharge of these
obligations” (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2010, 129).

Read 1 Nephi 7:3-5 to find out how the Lord helped
Lehi’s sons fulfill His commands. How did the Lord
help Ishmael and his family accept the invitation to
join Lehi’s family in the wilderness?

1. Ask your parents, a Church leader, or a teacher to

suggest three ways young people today can prepare for
marriage and raising children “unto the Lord.” Record their
counsel in your scripture study journal.

1 Nephi 7:6-15
Nephi tries to persuade his brethren to continue their
journey into the wilderness

Read 1 Nephi 7:6-7,

and find out why Laman,
Lemuel, and some of
Ishmael’s family rebelled
during their journey

in the wilderness.
Imagine what it would
be like to be Nephi in
this situation. Think of

Visualize the
Scriptures

Ky
Scripture study may become
more meaningful if you
picture in your mind what is
taking place. Imagine how
you might feel and act if
you were part of the event
described in the scriptures.
This can also help you real-

rebelling family members if they went back to
Jerusalem.

4. Write a paragraph in your scripture study journal |

about why it is essential to remember what the Lord
has done for you and follow His guidance.

1 Nephi 7:16-22

The Lord delivers Nephi

Continue to imagine what it would be like to be in
Nephi’s situation as you read 1 Nephi 7:16. What
would you do?

Nephi prayed. Read his prayer in 1 Nephi 7:17-18,
and identify what Nephi prayed for.

Notice that Nephi asked to be delivered “according
to [his] faith.” One of the lessons we learn from these
verses is that God answers prayers according to our
faith. Praying in faith means to pray with trust in the
Lord and always includes a willingness to act.

Study the following statement from Elder David A.
Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
concerning Nephi’s prayer in 1 Nephi 7:17 and

the power of the Atonement to change our hearts.
Underline any phrases that help you understand the
importance of being willing to act as we pray in faith.

“Do you know what I likely would have
prayed for if ] had been tied up by my

my brothers and ended with the phrase
‘wilt thou deliver me from the hands of

brothers? My prayer would have included
a request for something bad to happen to

Study helps provide insights

to Jerusalem. What three truths did Nephi say his
brothers had forgotten?

Answer the following in your scripture study journal:

2. How could remembering those three truths have
helped Laman and Lemuel be faithful to the Lord?
3. List 4-5 blessings you have received from the Lord.
How can remembering what the Lord has done for you
help you be faithful in choosing to follow Him?
Read 1 Nephi 7:13-15, and identify what Nephi said
would happen to Laman, Lemuel, and Ishmael’s

the enabling power of the Atonement of the Savior. .

“Brothers and sisters, the implication of this episode fot
each of us is quite straightforward. As you and come
to understand and employ the enabling power of the

Atonement in our personal lives, we will pray and seek

for strength to change our circumstances rather than
praying for our circumstances to be changed. We will
become agents who ‘act’ rather than objects that are
‘acted upon’ (2 Nephi 2:14)” (” ‘In the Strength of the
Lord’ (Words of Mormon 1:14; Mosiah 9:17; Mosiah
10:10; Alma 20:4),” in Brigham Young University 2001-
2002 Speeches [2002], 124).

Welcome to the Book of Mormon

What Is the Book of Mormon?

The Book of Mormon is another testament of Jesus Christ. It
contains the writings of ancient prophets, giving an account
of God's dealings with one branch of the house of Israel on
the American continent. For Latter-day Saints the Book of
Mormon stands alongside the Bible, the Doctrine and
Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price as holy scripture.
The Book of Mormon is a record of great ancient-American
civilizations.

Since it was first published in English in 1830, the Book
of Mormon has been translated into many languages, and
printed copies have totaled more than 150 million. It has
been described by prophets of God as the “keystone” of
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Why Is the Study of the Book of Mormon
Important to Me?

President Ezra Taft Benson taught that the blessing of
drawing nearer to God awaits you as you study the Book
of Mormon with a sincere heart:

“Is there not something deep in our hearts that longs to
draw nearer to God, to be more like Him in our daily walk,
to feel His presence with us constantly? If so, then the Book
of Mormon will help us do so more than any other book.

“It is not just that the Book of Mormon teaches us truth,
though it indeed does that. It is not just that the Book of
Mormon bears testimony of Christ, though it indeed does
that, too. But there is something more. There is a power in
the book which will begin to flow into your lives the moment
you begin a serious study of the book. You will find greater
power to resist temptation. You will find the power to avoid
deception. You will find the power to stay on the strait and
narrow path. The scriptures are called ‘the words of life’ (see
D&C 84:85), and nowhere is that more true than it is of the
Book of Mormon. When you begin to hunger and thirst after
those words, you will find life in greater and greater
abundance” (“The Book of Mormon—Keystone of Our
Religion,” Ensign, Nov. 1986, 7).

The Book of Mormon was written for us today. Mormon,
the ancient prophet after whom the book is named, and his
son Moroni abridged centuries of records when compiling
the gold plates from which the Prophet Joseph Smith
translated the Book of Mormon. God, who knows the end

from the beginning, inspired His prophets on what to
include in the abridgment that we would need for our day.
Moroni, who was the last of the prophets to write in the
Book of Mormon, foresaw our time: “Behold, | speak unto
you as if ye were present, and yet ye are not. But behold,
Jesus Christ hath shown you unto me, and | know your
doing” (Mormon 8:35).

President Benson also taught that studying the Book of
Mormon will help you discern between good and evil:

“The Book of Mormon brings men to Christ through two
basic means. First, it tells in a plain manner of Christ and his
gospel. It testifies of his divinity and of the necessity for a
Redeemer and the need of our putting trust in him. It bears
witness of the Fall and the Atonement and the first principles
of the gospel, including our need of a broken heart and a
contrite spirit and a spiritual rebirth. It proclaims we must
endure to the end in righteousness and live the moral life

of a Saint.

“Second, the Book of Mormon exposes the enemies of Christ.
It confounds false doctrines and lays down contention. (See

2 Ne. 3:12.) It fortifies the humble followers of Christ against
the evil designs, strategies, and doctrines of the devil in our day.
The type of apostates in the Book of Mormon are similar to the
type we have today. God, with his infinite foreknowledge, so
molded the Book of Mormon that we might see the error and
know how to combat false educational, political, religious, and
philosophical concepts of our time” (“The Book of Mormon Is
the Word of God,” Ensign, May 1975, 64).

About the Book of Mormon

The Book of Mormon is made up of 15 smaller books. Eight
of these books begin with a heading that was written on the
original gold plates translated by the Prophet Joseph Smith:

1 Nephi, 2 Nephi, Jacob, Alma, Helaman, 3 Nephi, 4 Nephi,
and Ether. Some chapters in the Book of Mormon are also
preceded by a heading that was included on the original gold
plates (except for the sentences about the inclusive chapters):
Mosiah 9, Mosiah 23, Alma 5, Alma 7, Alma 9, Alma 17,
Alma 21, Alma 36, Alma 38, Alma 39, Alma 45, Helaman 7,
Helaman 13, 3 Nephi 11, and Moroni 9.

At the beginning of each chapter in the Book of Mormon
there is a brief summary of the chapter printed in italics.
These chapter summaries were written and added under
the direction of the First Presidency and were not part of
the original Book of Mormon text from the gold plates.

Studying the
Scriptures

Introduction

The purpose of this lesson is to help you learn how to
study the scriptures and to invite the Holy Ghost to
inspire and teach you as you do so. This lesson will also
teach you skills that will help you better understand
the scriptures and apply their teachings in your life. As
you study this lesson, look for ways you can invite the
Holy Ghost into your gospel study.

Learn by Study and by Faith

Imagine that you want to improve your own physical
fitness, so you ask a friend to exercise for you. How
much would your friend’s exercising affect your
physical fitness? Relating this example to your spiritual
growth, just as one person cannot exercise for another,
one person cannot learn the gospel for another. Each
of us is responsible for our own gospel learning and
spiritual growth.

In Doctrine and Covenants 88:118, the Lord described

how to learn the gospel. As you read it, identify what

you need to do to learn the gospel and complete

the following statement: “Seek learning, even by
and also by v

To seek learning by study and by faith requires
individual effort. Your efforts to prayerfully study
the gospel will invite the Holy Ghost into the learning
process. Some of the ways to put forth effort in your
gospel study this year are to pray for understanding,
fulfill your seminary assignments, share your testimony
and your experiences in living the gospel with others,
and apply the things you learn in yout life.

One essential effort you can make to invite the Holy
Ghost to be a part of your spiritual learning is to study
the scriptures daily. Daily personal scripture study
helps you hear the voice of the Lord speaking to you
(see D&C 18:34-36). Elder Robert D. Hales of the
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles promised: “When we
want [God] to speak to us, we search the scriptures;
for His words are spoken through His prophets. He
will then teach us as we listen to the promptings of the
Holy Spirit” (“Holy Scriptures: The Power of God unto
Our Salvation,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2006, 26-27).

As you read the scriptures and invite the Holy Ghost
into your study, you will receive the blessings of greater

spiritual growth, a closeness to God, greater revelation
in your life, added strength to resist temptation, and a
greater testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

Scripture Study

President Marion G. Romney of the First Presidency
identified one of the key purposes for the scriptures
when he said, “The scriptures have been written to
preserve principles for our benefit” (“Records of Great
Worth,” Ensign, Sept. 1980, 4). We learn the principles
and doctrines of the gospel as we study the scriptures.
These principles and doctrines will guide us as we
apply them to our lives.

Finding the priceless principles and doctrines
contained in the scriptures takes effort and practice.
Elder Richard G. Scott of the Quorum of the
Twelve Apostles compared studying the
scriptures to the work of mining
valuable gems: “Find the diamonds
of truth that sometimes must be
carefully mined from the pages of
[scripture]” (“Four Fundamentals
for Those Who Teach and Inspire
Youth,” in Old Testament Symposium
Speeches, 1987 [1988], 1).The
process of studying, or mining, the
scriptures has three important parts:
(1) we must understand the background and setting of
the scriptures, (2) we must identify the principles and
doctrines being taught, and (3) we must apply those
truths to our own lives.

1. In your scripture study journal, answer the following

question: What are the similarities between a miner
searching for diamonds and someone searching the scriptures
for gospel principles and applying them in his or her life?

Understand the Background and Setting
of the Scriptures

Understanding the background and setting of a
scripture passage prepares you to recognize the gospel
messages it contains. President Thomas S. Monson
counseled: “Become acquainted with the lessons the
scriptures teach. Learn the background and setting.
... Study them as though they were speaking to you,
for such is the truth” (“Be Your Best Self,” Ensign or
Liahona, May 2009, 68).

When reading the scriptures, it is useful to ask
questions like: “Who wrote these verses?” “To
whom were they written?” “What is happening in
this account?” and “Why did the author write these
verses?” Chapter headings (the italicized summaries
at the beginning of each chapter) provide an overview
of the main events in the chapter and often answer
these questions.

It is also helpful to look up difficult or unfamiliar words
in a dictionary. When a phrase or passage of scripture
is unclear, referring to any available footnotes can help
you understand it better.

To practice using these tools, read 3 Nephi 17:1-10,
and look for answers to the following questions: Who
was the speaker? Who was He speaking to? What was
happening? Remember to look at the chapter heading
for a quick overview of the events taking place.

2. Using the footnote in 3 Nephi 17:1, answer the
following question in your scripture study journal: What
did Jesus mean when He said, “My time is at hand”?

3. In your scripture study journal, write in your own

words what happened when the Savior was preparing
to leave the multitude. Why did He stay? What did He do for
the people?

Identify the Doctrines and Principles

Doctrines and principles are eternal, unchanging
gospel truths that provide direction for our lives.
The ancient prophets teach us these truths through
the events, stories, or sermons they recorded in the
scriptures.

Once you understand the background and setting

of a passage of scripture, you are prepared to identify
the doctrines and principles that it teaches. Elder
Richard G. Scott described a helpful way to understand
principles: “Principles are concentrated truth, packaged
for application to a wide variety of circumstances. A
true principle makes decisions clear even under the
most confusing and compelling circumstances. It is
worth great effort to organize the truth we gather to
simple statements of principle” (“Acquiring Spiritual
Knowledge,” Ensign, Nov. 1993, 86).

Some gospel principles are made clear by the use of
phrases such as “thus we see” or “nevertheless.” Most
principles, however, are not stated directly. Instead
they are illustrated by the lives of the people in the
scriptures. These doctrines and principles can be
discovered by asking yourself questions like: “What

is the moral or point of this account?” “Why did the
writer include this account or event?” “What did the
author intend for us to learn?” and “What truths are
taught in this passage of scripture?”

4. To practice identifying some of the principles and

doctrines taught in 3 Nephi 17:1-10, write an answer for
either activity a or bin your scripture study journal. Remember to
read the heading for a quick overview of the chapter.

a. Who is speaking in these verses? Who is He talking to? What
is the moral or point of 3 Nephi 17:1-10?

b. What are some things the writer of verses 1, 5-6, and 9-10
intended for us to learn from this account? What are some
important truths you learned from these verses?

One of the gospel truths you might have identified
from these verses is: The Lord responds to our
genuine desires to draw closer to Him.

Apply Doctrines and Principles

After you have identified the gospel doctrines and
principles, you are ready to act and do something about
them. As you act on what you have learned, you will
feel the Holy Spirit witness to the truth of the principle
(see Moroni 10:4-5). Every lesson taught in the home,
at seminary and church, and in each Duty to God
activity and Personal Progress experience aims to help
us act on what we have been taught.

President Thomas S. Monson said: “The goal of gospel
teaching .. . is not to ‘pour information’
into the minds of the [learners]... . The
aim is to inspire the individual to think
about, feel about, and then do something
about living gospel principles” (in
Conference Report, Oct. 1970, 107).

a

To help you apply the principles you learn, ask
questions like: “What does the Lord want me to do
with this knowledge?” “What spiritual impressions
did I receive to help me improve?” “What difference
can this principle make in my life?” “What can I start
or stop doing now to live according to this truth?”
“How will my life be better if 1 do what this scripture
teaches?”

5. In your scripture study journal, write a short paragraph
describing how you can apply a principle or doctrine you
learned from 3 Nephi 17:1-10.

Scripture Study Skills and Methods

Using the following study skills and methods will help
you understand the background of the scriptures and
identify and apply the doctrines and principles taught
in them. These methods will be mentioned throughout
this manual. Read each skill, and select one or two you
feel you need to use more frequently in your personal
scripture study.

Cause and Effect. Look for if-then and
because-therefore relationships. Examples: 2 Nephi
13:16-26; Alma 34:33.

Cross-Reference. Group, link, or cluster scriptures
together to clarify meaning and unlock understanding.
For example, compare Mosiah 11:2-6, 14 and
Deuteronomy 17:14—20. You can also use footnotes
to find scripture cross-references. Example: 3 Nephi
12:28-29, footnote 29a, references Doctrine and
Covenants 42:23.

Determine Setting. Define the who, what, when, and
where of scriptural events. Example: Alma 31:1, 6-11;
32:1-6 gives the setting for Alma 32:21—43.

Key Words. Words and phrases like “nevertheless”
or “thus we see” are invitations to stop and look for
explanations of what was just written. Examples:
Alma 30:60; Helaman 6:35-36; 3 Nephi 18:30-32.

Marking Scriptures. Highlight, circle, or underline
important words and phrases in your scriptures that
give special meaning to the verse. Also write important
short thoughts, feelings, insights, or principles in the
margins. This will help you remember what made the
scripture important to you.

Name Substitution. Insert your name for one in the
scriptures. Example: Substitute your name for Nephi’s
in 1 Nephi 3:7.

Pondering. Pondering means to think deeply about
something. Pondering involves asking questions and
evaluating what you know and what you have learned.
Pondering often results in knowing how to apply a
principle in your life.

Repeated Words. Words or phrases that are repeated
may be important for the reader to pay attention to.
They are clues to what the writer felt was important.
Examples: The word awful in 2 Nephi 9:10, 19, 26-27,
39, 46-47; the word remember in Helaman 5:6-14.

Scripture Contrasts. On occasion, prophets place
accounts of different people, ideas, or events next to
each other in the scriptures. The contrast between
the two makes it easier to identify and understand
important gospel principles being taught. Look

for contrasts in single verses, scripture blocks, or
chapters. Examples: 2 Nephi 2:27; Alma 47-48.

Scripture Lists. Finding lists within the scriptures
can help you better understand what the Lord and
His prophets are teaching. When you find lists, you
may want to number each element. Example: The
list of wicked practices among the Nephites found in
Helaman 4:11-13.

Scripture Symbolism. Words such as like, as, or
likened unto help identify symbols. Try to determine
what the symbol stands for. Use the footnotes, Bible
Dictionary, and Topical Guide to help find the symbol’s
meaning. Example: Compare Jacob 5:3, 75-77 with
Jacob 6:1-7.

Visualization. Picture in your mind what is taking
place as you read. Ask questions about the event, and
imagine being present when it took place. Example:
Try to visualize what is taking place in Enos 1:1-8.

Word Definitions. The scriptures often use words
that are not familiar to us. When you encounter an
unfamiliar word, use the Bible Dictionary, footnotes,
or a regular dictionary to find its meaning.

6. Select and use one of the skills from the preceding

“Scripture Study Skills and Methods” section. In your
scripture study journal, write about how that skill helped you
in your personal scripture study.

7. Write the following at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture study journal:

| have studied the “Studying the Scriptures” lesson and completed
it on (date).

Additional questions, thoughts, and insights | would like to share
with my teacher:

The Plan of Salvation

Introduction

Our Heavenly Father has provided for us, His children,
a plan intended to lead all of us to eternal happiness
and exaltation. Central to His plan is the Atonement
of Jesus Christ. The Atonement overcomes the effects
of the Fall and makes it possible for us to repent and
be cleansed of our sins so that we might have joy in
this life and in eternity.

This lesson will give you a brief overview of Heavenly
Father’s plan of salvation. It can help you see how

the gospel truths you will learn this year relate to

one another and to your purpose on earth. As your
understanding of the plan of salvation grows, your
faith in God and His Son, Jesus Christ, will increase,
as will your ability to fulfill your part in the plan. The
plan of salvation is “the fulness of the gospel of Jesus
Christ, designed to bring about man’s immortality
and eternal life. It includes the Creation, Fall, and
Atonement, along with all God-given laws, ordinances,
and doctrines. This plan makes it possible for all people
to be exalted and live forever with God” (Guide to the
Scriptures, “Plan of Redemption,” scriptures.lds.org).

The Plan Helps Us Understand Our Purpose
in Mortality

Our Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation answers many
questions that most people have considered at some
point in their lives. Have you ever pondered questions
such as: “Where did I come from?” “Why am I here?”
“Where do I go after this life?”

Before we were born on the earth, we lived in the
presence of our Heavenly Father as His spirit children.
We are literally His children, and He loves us. His plan
of salvation is the way for each of us to become like
He is and enjoy all of His blessings. We understood
and accepted His plan before we came to earth.

The Book of Mormon plays a central role in our
understanding the plan of salvation. Book of Mormon
prophets used many different terms when referring to
the plan.

1. Read the scriptures listed below, and identify the

name used for Heavenly Father's plan in each verse. In
your scripture study journal, write the name next to the scripture
reference. The first one is identified for you.

a. 2 Nephi 9:6 “The merciful plan of the great Creator”
b. 2 Nephi 11:5
c. Alma 12:25
d. Alma 24:14
e. Alma 42:8

f. Alma 42:15

Words such as merciful, deliverance, salvation, happiness,
and redemption emphasize the doctrine that Heavenly
Father’s plan is designed to bring His children
eternal salvation and happiness.

2. Respond to the

following question in
your scripture study journal:
How does knowing that
Heavenly Father has a plan
for your happiness and
exaltation make a difference
in your life?

The Role of Agency
and the Fall of Adam
and Eve in the Plan
of Salvation

Adam and Eve were

the first of Heavenly
Father’s children to come
to this earth. He placed
them in the Garden of
Eden and gave them
their agency—“the
ability and privilege

... to choose and to

act for themselves”

Scripture Study
Journals

| \¥
During your home-study
experience you will have
the opportunity to respond
to questions and share your
insights with your teacher
in a scripture study journal.
Recording your thoughts and
impressions, as well as writing
answers to questions from the
manual, can invite revelation
and help you understand the
particular scriptures. Take your
scripture study journal with
you to your weekly home-study
class so you will be prepared to
discuss what you have learned
and show your teacher the
work you have cone.

(Guide to the Scriptures, “Agency,” scriptures.Ids.
org). He commanded them not to eat of the fruit of
the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Obeying this
commandment meant that they would be able to
remain in the garden, but they could not progress by
experiencing opposition in mortality. They could not
know joy because they could not experience sorrow

and pain.

Read 2 Nephi 2:17-20 and look for what happened
to Adam and Eve after they chose to disobey God’s
commandment. In the space provided, describe what
Adam and Eve chose to do and two of the effects that
choice—commonly referred to as the Fall—had on

them:

Read 2 Nephi 2:22-26 and identify more of the
consequences of the choice Adam and Eve made.
Mark in your scriptures additional truths you learn
about the effects of the Fall.

3. In your scripture study journal, finish the following

paragraph by describing effects of the Fall of Adam and
Eve on you personally. Include ideas about choices, agency,
physical bodies, death, children, and sin.

“Because of Adam's and Eve's transgression, | am also in a

fallen state and...”

The Role of Jesus Christ's Atonement in the
Plan of Salvation

Sin and death separate us from the presence of our
Father in Heaven. We cannot return to God’s presence
without divine help. We must understand the role

of Jesus Christ and His Atonement in the plan of
salvation so that we can have faith in Him and follow
Heavenly Father's plan. Study Mosiah 3:17-19, looking
for phrases that describe how the Atonement of Jesus
Christ overcomes the effects of the Fall and helps us
gain happiness and return to our Heavenly Father.
Summarize these verses in your own words:

A principle we learn is: Jesus Christ is the central
figure in the plan of salvation, and His Atonement

is what makes the plan work for all of God’s
children.

4. Read the following scripture passages: 2 Nephi 2:8;
Mosiah 3:7-11; 16:4—8; Alma 34:9, 15-16; Mormon
9:13-14. In your scripture study journal, write a paragraph
explaining what they teach about the central role of the
Atonement of Jesus Christ in the plan of salvation. You
may wish to underline phrases that are meaningful to you.

Our Responsibility in the Plan of Salvation

Heavenly Father has provided His perfect plan to bring
about our eternal happiness and exaltation with Him
and our loved ones. Jesus Christ has fulfilled His role
in the plan, overcoming death and making it possible
for us to overcome sin and return to live again with our
Father in Heaven. However, this does not eliminate
our responsibility in the plan.

5. In your scripture study journal, write Some of my

responsibilities in the plan of salvation, and list what
each of the following scriptures teaches about our personal
responsibility to invite the power of the Atonement into our
lives and fully partake of the blessings of the plan of salvation:

a. 2 Nephi 2:25-27

b. Mosiah 3:12-13

c. Alma 12:24—-25, 32-34

d. 3 Nephi 27:13-14, 20-22, 27

These scriptures can help us understand that as we
choose to live the gospel of Jesus Christ and follow
God's plan, we prepare to receive eternal life
through the Savior’s Atonement.

6. Suppose you were asked to give a talk in church about

the plan of salvation. Using what you have learned from
the scriptures in the above assignment, write in your scripture
study journal what you would say about our personal
responsibility in Heavenly Father's plan.

Ponder what you could do to better fulfill your
responsibility in Heavenly Father's plan and to invite
the Savior’s power into your life. Consider sharing your
thoughts with one of your parents, a sibling, or a close
friend.

The Plan of Salvation Provides Answers
and Direction

An understanding of the plan of salvation can guide
you when making decisions and finding answers to
questions you or others may face.

7. In your scripture study journal, respond to one of the
questions below by telling how understanding the plan
of salvation provides guidance and answers:

a. How does knowing you are a literal son or daughter of God
affect your feelings of self-worth?

b. How would you respond to someone who says, “It’s my
life—'ll do what | want to do”?

c. How could understanding the plan of salvation help someone
overcome feelings that life is just about having fun and
satisfying our own desires for pleasure?

d. How could you use your knowledge of the plan of salvation

to help someone who is experiencing trials and feels it is
because God doesn’t love him or her?

Understanding the plan of salvation can help you obey
God’s commandments because it explains why we
should obey them (see Alma 12:32).

8. Read 2 Nephi 2:25, and summarize the purpose of the
plan of salvation by answering the following question in

your scripture study journal: In what ways has the plan of
salvation brought joy to you and to your family?

9. Write the following at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture study journal:

with my teacher:

Title Page,
Introduction,
and Testimonies
of Witnesses

Introduction

Imagine that a friend asked you why members of The
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints need the
Book of Mormon if we already have the Bible. (Perhaps
you have already had this experience!) What would
you say to your friend?

The Book of Mormon begins with a title page and an
introduction that explain the purpose of this sacred
book, including the effect it can have on our testimony
and relationship to God. The opening pages of the
Book of Mormon also contain the testimonies of
witnesses who saw the gold plates from which the
book was translated and bore testimony of its divine
origin.

As you complete this lesson, think about how you can
gain the most from your study of the Book of Mormon
this year and how the Book of Mormon can help you
develop a greater testimony of the Savior Jesus Christ
and His restored gospel.

The Title Page

The Prophet Joseph Smith explained that the ancient
prophet Moroni included the title page of the Book
of Mormon on the gold plates: “The title-page of the
Book of Mormon is a literal translation, taken from the
very last leaf, on the left hand side of the collection

or book of plates, which contained the record which
has been translated, ...and... said title page is not
by any means a modern composition, either of mine
or of any other man who has lived or does live in this
generation” (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph
Smith [2007], 60-61).

As you read the first paragraph on the title page, look
for words and phrases Moroni used to testify of the
Lord’s involvement in the coming forth of the Book
of Mormon.

1. In your scripture study journal, explain why it is
important to you to know how involved the Lord was in
the writing and translation of the Book of Mormon.

As you read the second paragraph on the title page,
look for what the three main purposes Moroni gave for
the Book of Mormon being written. (You may want to
mark these in your scriptures.) The “house of Israel”
refers to those who are descendants of Jacob as well as
those who are covenant members of the Lord’s church
(see Bible Dictionary, “Israel”). Additionally, the phrase
“Jew and Gentile” includes all of Heavenly Father’s
children. In the second paragraph, personalize the
message of the title page by substituting your name for
“the remnant of the House of Israel” and for “the Jew
and Gentile.”

2. In your scripture study journal, explain how knowing
these purposes of the Book of Mormon help you
understand its importance.

President Ezra Taft Benson said the following about the
“major mission” or purpose of the Book of Mormon:

“The major mission of the Book of Mormon, as
recorded on its title page, is ‘to the convincing of the
Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the eternal
God, manifesting himself unto all nations.’

“The honest seeker after truth can gain the testimony
that Jesus is the Christ as he prayerfully ponders the
inspired words of the Book of Mormon.

“Over one-half of all the verses in the Book of
Mormon refer to our Lord. Some form of Christ’s name
is mentioned more frequently per verse in the Book of
Mormon than even in the New Testament” (“Come
unto Christ,” Ensign, Nov. 1987, 83).

As its title page proclaims, the Book of Mormon is
a witness that Jesus is the Christ. As you study the
Book of Mormon this year, focus on what you learn
about Jesus Christ and ask Heavenly Father in prayer
to confirm what you are learning through the power
of the Holy Ghost.

The Introduction to the Book of Mormon

Have you ever wondered how an arch in a bridge or

a building is able to keep from falling with no support
underneath it? When an arch is constructed, the two
sides are built up with supports to hold them. The space
at the top of the arch is then carefully measured, and a
stone, called the “keystone,” is cut to fit it exactly. When
the keystone is put in place, the arch can stand without
outside support. Imagine what would happen to the
arch if the keystone was removed.

Keystone

Turn to the introduction to the Book of Mormon and
read the sixth paragraph, which begins “Concerning
this record .. .” As you read this paragraph, look for
three significant principles the Prophet Joseph Smith
taught concerning the Book of Mormon.

President Ezra Taft Benson explained more about

how the Book of Mormon acts as the keystone of our
religion. As you read the quotation, underline phrases
or statements that could help you describe to someone
else the central role the Book of Mormon plays in our
religion.

“There are three ways in which the Book of Mormon

is the keystone of our religion. It is the keystone in our
witness of Christ. It is the keystone of our doctrine. It

is the keystone of testimony.

“The Book of Mormon is the keystone in our witness
of Jesus Christ, who is Himself the cornerstone of
everything we do. It bears witness of His reality with
power and clarity. ...

“The Lord Himself has stated that the Book of
Mormon contains the ‘fulness of the gospel of Jesus
Christ’ (D&C 20:9). That does not mean it contains
every teaching, every doctrine ever revealed. Rather,
it means that in the Book of Mormon we will find the
fulness of those doctrines required for our salvation.
And they are taught plainly and simply so that

even children can learn the ways of salvation and
exaltation. .. .

“Finally, the Book of Mormon is the keystone of
testimony. Just as the arch crumbles if the keystone
is removed, so does all the Church stand or fall with
the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. The enemies
of the Church understand this clearly. This is why
they go to such great lengths to try to disprove the
Book of Mormon, for if it can be discredited, the
Prophet Joseph Smith goes with it. So does our claim
to priesthood keys, and revelation, and the restored
Church. But in like manner, if the Book of Mormon be
true—and millions have now testified that they have
the witness of the Spirit that it is indeed true—then
one must accept the claims of the Restoration and
all that accompanies it” (“The Book of Mormon—
Keystone of Our Religion,” Ensign, Nov. 1986, 5-6).

3. Read the eighth paragraph of the introduction to

the Book of Mormon, which begins “We invite all men
everywhere... ,” and identify how you can know the Book of
Mormon is true. After you have read the paragraph, complete
the following sentence in your scripture study journal: As we
read, ponder, and pray, the Holy Ghost will...

Just as the keystone supports the other stones in an
arch, a testimony of the Book of Mormon strengthens
our testimonies of other important principles of the
gospel. Read the ninth paragraph of the introduction,
which begins “Those who gain this divine

witness. ..,” and underline three additional truths
you will gain a witness of as you follow the counsel in
the eighth paragraph. As we read, ponder, and pray
about the Book of Mormon, the Holy Ghost will
witness that it is true, that Jesus is the Christ, that
Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, and that The

Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the
Lord’s kingdom on earth.

4. Inyour scripture study journal, explain why the Book
of Mormon is called the keystone of our religion.

The Testimonies of the Witnesses

Imagine you are a judge trying to determine the truth
about what happened in a dispute between two parties.
What value would there be of having a witness to what
happened? What greater value would there be of having
many witnesses?

The Lord showed several witnesses the gold plates from
which Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon.
Read “The Testimony of Three Witnesses,” and mark
three or four phrases they used to testify of the plates
and the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. Then
read “The Testimony of the Eight Witnesses.” Notice
the differences in the experiences of the two groups,

as shown in the table below.

Three Witnesses Eight Witnesses

1. An angel showed them
the plates, the Urim and
Thummim, the breast-
plate, the Liahona, and
the sword of Laban.

1. Joseph Smith showed
them the plates.

2. The voice of God declared
the divinity of the record.

2. They handled (“hefted”)
the gold plates.

5. Answer the following question in your scripture study
journal: Why is it important that there were other witnesses
of the gold plates in addition to Joseph Smith?

6. In your scripture study journal, write your own

testimony regarding the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith,
and the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. If you feel you do not
yet have your own testimony, write what you will do to develop
a testimony of the Book of Mormon this year. To strengthen your
testimony, share your feelings about what you wrote with one of
your parents or another family member or friend.

Overview of the
Book of Mormon

Introduction

The Prophet Joseph Smith described the events
surrounding the coming forth of the Book of
Mormon. By studying his account, your testimony

Developing a
Testimony

.\4
President Boyd K. Packer of the
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
taught how we can develop
a testimony by sharing it with
others:

“A testimony is to be found in
the bearing of it! ...

“It is one thing to receive a
witness from what you have
read or what another has said;
and that is a necessary begin-
ning. It is quite another to
have the Spirit confirm to you
in your bosom that what you
have testified is true” (“The
Candle of the Lord,” Ensign,
Jan. 1983, 54-55).

of his prophetic calling
and of the Book of
Mormon’s divine role
in the Restoration of the
fulness of the gospel of
Jesus Christ can deepen.
This lesson will also
help you become more
familiar with how the
Book of Mormon was
written anciently. The
prophets Mormon and
Moroni testified of the
Lord’s direction as they
wrote and compiled the
writings of many other
prophets on the gold
plates. As you study, look
for evidence of the Lord’s
hand in bringing forth
the Book of Mormon
and for the role the Book
of Mormon can have in
guiding your life.

“Testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith”

How would you answer the question “How did your
Church get the Book of Mormon?”

The “Testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith,” found
in the introductory materials at the beginning of the

Book of Mormon, contains excerpts from Joseph
Smith—History, found in the Pearl of Great Price. It
describes the coming forth of the Book of Mormon in
the Prophet’s own words. You are encouraged to read
his entire account from Joseph Smith—History during
your daily scripture study.

Because “Testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith”
does not include verse numbers, this lesson will
reference Joseph Smith—History to make it easier for
you to find the reading assignments. As you study the
Prophet Joseph’s testimony, look for evidence that the
Book of Mormon came forth by the power of God.

Read Joseph Smith—History 1:29-35, 42-43, and
underline details of Moroni’s visit to Joseph Smith that
you would include if you were explaining these events
to someone else. In Joseph Smith—History 1:34, what
did Moroni say was contained on the gold plates?

1. Answer the following questions in your scripture study

journal: What one thing in Joseph Smith—History 1:29-
35, 42-43 would you want to emphasize if you were sharing this
account with someone else? Why is it significant to you?

2. Read Joseph Smith—History 1:51-54, and record your

thoughts about the following questions in your scripture
study journal: What did Joseph Smith learn during his yearly visits
with the angel Moroni? Why do you think it was important for
Joseph to have this four-year period of instruction before
obtaining and translating the plates?

After a season of preparation and instruction,
Joseph Smith was given the plates in 1827 and the
responsibility to translate them by the gift and power
of God. Read Joseph Smith—History 1:59-60, and
identify the charge he was given concerning the gold
plates.

“A Brief Explanation about the Book of
Mormon"

To understand how the Book of Mormon is organized,
read “A Brief Explanation about the Book of Mormon,”
which is found after “Testimony of the Prophet Joseph
Smith.” Compare what you read with the illustration
found at the end of this lesson, which illustrates how
the different sets of plates fit together to make up the
Book of Mormon record.

Many individuals served as record keepers during the
history of the Nephites and Lamanites, beginning
with Lehi and concluding over 1,000 years later with
the prophet-historian Mormon and his son Moroni.
Mormon was directed by the Lord to abridge the
writings of these ancient prophets and the 1,000-year
history of his people. His abridgement was recorded on
the plates of Mormon, also known as the gold plates.
Following Mormon’s death, his son Moroni finished
the record and the plates were hidden until they were
given to the Prophet Joseph Smith.

Helaman 3:13-15 is one of several passages where
Mormon described making an abridgement of the
Nephite records. As you read it, notice that there was
much more written than Mormon and Moroni were
able to include on the gold plates.

Read Words of Mormon 1:9 and Mormon 8:34-35.
Highlight words or phrases that describe how the
Lord helped and directed Mormon and Moroni as
they compiled the Book of Mormon record.

3. Answer the following question in your scripture study

journal: If you were Mormon or Moroni and had the
responsibility to condense the volumes of prophetic writings into
a single record, how would you decide what to include in your
abridgement?

From these verses we can see that the Book of
Mormon writers saw our day and wrote what
would be of most help to us. You may want to note
this in your scriptures by Mormon 8:35.

President Ezra Taft Benson testified that the Book of
Mormon “was written for our day” and explained
how knowing this can help us as we study the Book
of Mormon:

10

“The Nephites never had the book; neither did the
Lamanites of ancient times. It was meant for us.
Mormon wrote near the end of the Nephite civilization.
Under the inspiration of God, who sees all things
from the beginning, he abridged centuries of records,
choosing the stories, speeches, and events that would
be most helpful to us. ...

“Tf they saw our day, and chose those things which
would be of greatest worth to us, is not that how

we should study the Book of Mormon? We should
constantly ask ourselves, ‘Why did the Lord inspire
Mormon (or Moroni or Alma) to include that in his
record? What lesson can I learn from that to help me
live in this day and age?’” (“The Book of Mormon—
Keystone of Our Religion,” Ensign, Nov. 1986, 6).

Asking these types of questions as you study will help
you discover the principles and doctrines the Lord
knew would be the greatest help to you in yout life.

Think about your life right now. Reflect on questions
you have or situations you are facing that you would
like to receive some direction about from God. Write
one or two of them in your personal journal (not your
scripture study journal that you show to your teacher).
During your study of the Book of Mormon each day,
look for principles that offer guidance and counsel
related to these situations.

Regarding daily scripture study, President
Gordon B. Hinckley said: “You may think
you are too busy. Ten or fifteen minutes a
day with the scriptures, and particularly
with the Book of Mormon, can give you
marvelous understanding of the great
eternal truths which have been preserved by the power
of the Almighty for the blessing of His children. As you
read ..., you will draw closer to Him who is the author
of our salvation” (“Rise to the Stature of the Divine
within You,” Ensign, Nov. 1989, 97).

4. Ponder what goal you could set that would help you

get the most from your reading of the Book of Mormon
this year. Record your goal in your scripture study journal. You
might want to establish regular times to evaluate your progress.

INTRODUCTION TO
1 Nephi

Why Study This Book?

As you study 1 Nephi, you will discover that “the
tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom
he hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them
mighty” (1 Nephi 1:20). For instance, you will see how
God helped Nephi obtain the brass plates so his family
could have the scriptures, how God saved Nephi from
physical threats on his life, and how God saved Lehi
and his people from famine in the wilderness and
destruction on the ocean, delivering them safely to
the promised land.

Lehi and his people experienced God’s mercy and
help as they kept the commandments. Lehi and Nephi
sought guidance from God and received it through
the scriptures, dreams, visions, and the Liahona. Nephi
received and recorded a vision of earth’s history that
showed him the all-knowing power of God. Through
visions, Nephi saw the future baptism, ministry, and
crucifixion of Jesus Christ.

As you study the experiences of Nephi and Lehi in
this book, you can learn how to seek and receive the
blessings of heaven in your life.

Who Wrote This Book?

Lehi’s son Nephi wrote this book in response to the
Lord’s command that he keep a record of his people.
Nephi was likely born in or near Jerusalem. He lived
there during the ministry of the prophet Jeremiah
and the reign of King Zedekiah.

Nephi sought his own witness about his father’s
words concerning the destruction of Jerusalem and
the need for their family to leave. As he continued
to seek and follow the counsel of the Lord, Nephi
became an instrument in God's hands. He obediently
returned to Jerusalem with his brothers twice—first
to obtain the brass plates and later to persuade
Ishmael’s family to join Lehi’s family in the wilderness.
With the Lord’s help, Nephi built the ship that

took his family and others across the ocean to the
promised land. When Lehi died, Nephi became the
leader of his people.

When and Where Was It Written?

Nephi wrote the account that became 1 Nephi in
approximately 570 8.c.—30 years after he and his
family left Jerusalem (see 2 Nephi 5:28-31). He
wrote it when he was in the land of Nephi.

UNIT 2: DAY 1
1 Nephi 1

Introduction

The Book of Mormon begins with Nephi’s account of his
father, Lehi, faithfully fulfilling his roles as a prophet and
as the priesthood leader of his family. Understanding
Lehi’s ministry can help you better understand the role
of prophets in our day. He was one of “many prophets,
prophesying unto the [Jews] that they must repent”

(1 Nephi 1:4). Because Lehi was obedient to God and
prophesied of the destruction of Jerusalem, the people
mocked him and sought to kill him. Nevertheless, Lehi
rejoiced in the Lord’s mercy and power of deliverance.
As you study 1 Nephi 1, think about how God’s mercy
and personal involvement are shown in your own life.

1 Nephi 1:1-3
Nephi begins his record

Read 1 Nephi 1:1, and identify key words and phrases
that reveal what Nephi's life was like.

1. From what you read in verse 1, write in your scripture
study journal about at least one way you feel your life is
similar to Nephi’s life.

2. Answer the following question in your scripture study
journal: How do you think Nephi could have “seen many
afflictions” yet also be “highly favored of the Lord in all [his] days”?

1 Nephi 1:4—20

Blessings of
Scripture Study

One of your opportunities this
year as a seminary student is
to read the Book of Mormon.
Reading the scriptures
strengthens your relation-
ship with the Lord. President
Spencer W. Kimball taught: “!

my relationships with divinity
and when it seems that no
divine ear is listening and no
divine voice is speaking, that |
am far, far away. If | immerse
myself in the scriptures the

destruction of Jerusalem

Think of a time when
your parents or Church
leaders warned you about
something dangerous.
What was their motive

in warning you?

Our Heavenly Father
loves us and wants

us to be safe from sin,
which harms us. One
of the ways God warns
His children is through
prophets. Prophets

warn against sin and
teach salvation through
Jesus Christ. As you
study 1 Nephi 1, look for

spirituality returns” (Teachings
of Presidents of the Church:
Spencer W. Kimball [2006], 67).

evidence of this principle. Nephi began his record by
telling us that many prophets preached and warned the
people about what would happen if they didn’t repent
(see 1 Nephi 1:4). Read 1 Nephi 1:5—7, and mark in your
scriptures how Lehi prayed and what he prayed about.
Lehi’s prayer to the Lord shows that he believed what
the prophets were saying.

Read 1 Nephi 1:8—10, and circle below all that Lehi
saw in the vision.

God Angels

Jesus Christ Twelve others

Read 1 Nephi 1:11-12, and notice what happened to
Lehi as he read the book he was given. Through this
vision the Lord further prepared Lehi to minister
among the people of Jerusalem. Read 1 Nephi 1:13,
and note what Lehi was
taught concerning
Jerusalem. As you read,
put yourself in Lehi’s
place and imagine how
you would feel if the
Lord told you that these
things would happen to
your home and city.

Being warned about the
destruction of his people
and city would obviously
have been very difficult for Lehi. Yet, read 1 Nephi
1:14-15, and discover why Lehi rejoiced even though
he saw that Jerusalem would be destroyed.

3. Write your thoughts about the following question in

your scripture study journal: How might Lehi’s experience
in 1 Nephi 1:5-15 influence his desire to teach the people and
invite them to repent?

After being warned about the destruction of Jerusalem,
Lehi shared with the people of Jerusalem what he had
learned. He warned them that they would be destroyed
if they did not repent. Read 1 Nephi 1:18-20, and
identify how the people of Jerusalem reacted. Imagine
you were an editor for a newspaper and you had to
write a headline for 1 Nephi 1:18-20. What would be
your headline?

Ponder the following statement:

“Like the prophets of old, prophets today testify

of Jesus Christ and teach His gospel. They make
known God’s will and true character. They speak
boldly and clearly, denouncing sin and warning of
its consequences. At times, they may be inspired to

prophesy of future events for our benefit” (True to the
Faith: A Gospel Reference [2004], 129).

4. In your own words, write a sentence in your scripture
study journal describing the responsibility of a prophet
regardless of the opposition he might face.

As Nephi wrote about his father’s experiences in
Jerusalem, he added a message to the reader partway
through 1 Nephi 1:20, starting with the phrase “But
behold, I, Nephi will show unto you . . .” This verse
introduces a theme Nephi emphasized throughout his
writing. Underline this theme in 1 Nephi 1:20, and then
read Moroni 10:3 looking for a similar theme. (Moroni
was the last of the Book of Mormon prophets. The time
between Nephi and Moroni was about 1,000 years.)

Notice that Nephi declared in the first chapter of the
Book of Mormon that he would show us “the tender
mercies of the Lord” in his writings (1 Nephi 1:20). In
the last chapter of the Book of Mormon, Moroni told
us to remember “how merciful the Lord hath been”
(Moroni 10:3).

Nephi wanted us to understand right from the
beginning of his record that the Lord’s tender mercies
are extended to those who exercise faith in Him.
Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of
the Twelve Apostles explained what the
Lord’s tender mercies are in our life. Circle
words and phrases Elder Bednar used to
describe what the “tender mercies of the
Lord” are as you read his explanation:

“The Lord’s tender mercies are the very personal

and individualized blessings, strength, protection,
assurances, guidance, loving-kindnesses, consolation,
support, and spiritual gifts which we receive from and
because of and through the Lord Jesus Christ. . . .
“... The Lord’s tender mercies do not occur randomly
or merely by coincidence. Faithfulness, obedience, and
humility invite tender mercies into our lives, and it is
often the Lord’s timing that enables us to recognize
and treasure these important blessings” (“The Tender
Mercies of the Lord,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2005,
99-100).

5. In your scripture study journal, answer the following

question: What example have you seen of the Lord’s
extending His tender mercies in your life or in the life of
someone you know?

Begin or continue to look for and record in your personal
journal the tender mercies the Lord has extended to you.
As you do, you will more readily see the blessings God
has extended to you.

6. Write the following at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture study journal:

Additional questions, thoughts, and insights | would like to share
with my teacher:

1 Nephi 2

Introduction

People respond to revelation from God in various
ways. The Lord commanded Lehi in a dream to lead
his family into the wilderness. Laman and Lemuel
murmured against God’s commands while Nephi
sought a confirming witness. Comparing their different
responses will help you decide how to use your agency
when responding to the Lord’s direction.

1 Nephi 2:1-7
God commands Lehi to depart into the wilderness

Imagine you were Lehi and the Lord asked you
and your family to leave your home and all of your
possessions. You would have to walk for days and
could only take provisions to sustain your family’s
needs. Think about how you would respond to such
a request.

Read 1 Nephi 2:1—6, and look for the circumstances
that led to Lehi and his family departing into the
wilderness.

14

Why did the people “seek to take away [Lehi’s] life”?

(see 1 Nephi 2:1).

What did the Lord command Lehi to do? (see 1 Nephi
2:2).

Lehi is an example of the gospel principle that when
we are faithful and obedient, the Lord will help us
in times of trial.

1. In your scripture study journal, answer the following
question about 1 Nephi 2:4: What can you learn from
Lehi’s choices of what to take and what to leave behind?

To help you better understand the geography of Lehi’s
journey, review the map at the end of the lesson.

Read 1 Nephi 2:7, and note what Lehi did after leaving
with his family to travel in the wilderness. What word

could you use to describe an important character trait
Lehi showed?

1 Nephi 2:8-14
Laman and Lemuel murmur against their father
All four of Lehi’s sons made the same journey, but

they did so with different attitudes toward God’s
commandments.

Study 1 Nephi 2:8—10, and circle the words river and
valley.

2. In your scripture study journal, write your thoughts

about the following question: What do you think Lehi
tried to teach Laman and Lemuel by comparing them to a river
and a valley?

Read 1 Nephi 2:11-14, and find the reasons Laman
and Lemuel murmured against their father. (Note: The
word stiffneckedness means stubbornness and pride.)
One reason Satan encourages murmuring is to prevent
people from following living prophets, inspired leaders,
and parents. Elder H. Ross Workman of the Seventy
spoke about murmuring. He said that “murmuring
consists of three steps, each leading to the next ina
descending path to disobedience.”

First, when people murmur, they use their

own judgment and begin to question the

teachings of the living prophets. “They

[question] first in their own minds and

L then [plant] questions in the minds of
others.”

Second, those who murmur begin “to rationalize and
excuse themselves from doing what they [have] been
instructed to do... . Thus, they [make] an excuse for
disobedience.

“The third step inevitably follows: slothfulness in
following the commandment of the Master [see D&C
58:29]...

“T invite you to focus on the commandment from
living prophets that bothers you the most. Do you
question whether the commandment is applicable
to you? Do you find ready excuses why you cannot
now comply with the commandment? Do you feel
frustrated or irritated with those who remind you of
the commandment? Are you slothful in keeping it?
Beware of the deception of the adversary. Beware of
murmuring” (“Beware of Murmuring,” Ensign, Nov.
2001, 85-86).

3. Respond to the following question in your scripture

study journal: What can you do if you find yourself
murmuring (complaining) about a commandment or Church
standard?

1 Nephi 2:16-19
Nephi seeks understanding from the Lord

Read 1 Nephi 2:16, 19, and mark what Nephi wanted
and what he did that led him to accept the Lord’s
commandments given through his father. Although
Nephi did not murmur, ponder how what he wrote
in 1 Nephi 2:16 about the Lord softening his heart
hints that leaving Jerusalem may have been difficult
for him too.

4. In your scripture study journal, share an example of a

time when, like Nephi, you called upon Heavenly Father
and experienced a softening of your heart through the Spirit or of
a time when you received a testimony of something the Lord said.

Nephi’s experience teaches us the following gospel
principle: When we call upon God, He can soften
our hearts to believe His words.

Read 1 Nephi 2:17-18, and identify Nephi’s desires
and actions after the Lord softened his heart. Think
about what you can learn from the different reactions
of Nephi, Sam, Laman, and Lemuel. The following is
one important truth: When we share what we have
learned through the Holy Spirit, others may believe
our words.

5. Write in your scripture study journal about a time
when someone's words led you to believe the word of
God, like Sam believed Nephi.

Think about someone with whom you could share
something that the Spirit has helped you learn and feel
is true. It may be a friend, a member of your family, a
Church leader, or a teacher. Take the opportunity this
week to talk with that person and share that testimony.

1 Nephi 2:20-24
The Lord assures Nephi that he will prosper through his
obedience

Identify and mark the promise contained in 1 Nephi

1 Nephi 3-4

Introduction

The Lord commanded Lehi to send his sons back to
Jerusalem to obtain the plates of brass from Laban.
While Laman and Lemuel did not see how they would
fulfill this command, Nephi had faith that the Lord
would provide a way to accomplish what He required.
Despite repeated difficulties, Nephi faithfully persisted
in doing what the Lord had asked. As a result, he

was led by the Holy Spirit and successfully obtained
the plates. Nephi’s experience shows that persistent
obedience qualifies us for the Lord’s help in difficult
situations.

1 Nephi 3:1-9, 19-20
Lehi’s sons return to Jerusalem

Have you ever faced a difficult situation and wondered
how it would be resolved? Today’s lesson can help
strengthen your faith and determination to be
obedient as you face difficult situations. Begin by
reading 1 Nephi 3:16, and highlight in your scriptures
the command the Lord gave Lehi for his sons to fulfill.
Also notice the difference in how Laman and Lemuel
responded to the Lord’s command as opposed to
Nephi’s response.

To understand the difficulty of what the Lord
commanded, it is helpful to know that the distance
from Jerusalem to the Red Sea (the Gulf of Aqaba) is
about 180 miles through hot, barren country infested
by many thieves. Lehi and his family had traveled
three days’ journey beyond this point (see 1 Nephi
2:5-6), and now the Lord was saying his sons were to
go back to Jerusalem. Read 1 Nephi 3:7-8, and identify

the reason Nephi gave for his willingness to obey
the Lord’s command.

Nephi testified of the principle that if we will do
what the Lord commands, then He will prepare
a way for us to accomplish it. As you continue to
study 1 Nephi 3, think about how Nephi’s example
of courage and determination can inspire you to be
more obedient and show greater faith in the Lord.
Pay particular attention to how Nephi responded to
difficulties. Even though Nephi would face adversity
as he and his brothers tried to obtain the plates of
brass, he chose not to murmur (see 1 Nephi 3:6).

The plates of brass contained “the record of the

Jews” (1 Nephi 3:3), which were their scriptures.

They contained some of the writings and information
currently found in the Old Testament as well as other
prophetic writings. Read 1 Nephi 3:19-20, and underline
what the plates of brass contained that made them so
important to Lehi’s family and descendants.

CJ Scripture Mastery—1 Nephi 3:7

Read 1 Nephi 3:7 three times (you may wish to vary
how you read it: out loud or silently). Close your
scriptures, and try to write answers to the following
questions without looking at the verse:

e Who was Nephi speaking to?

e What did Nephi commit to do?

e What did Nephi know the Lord would do?

Open your scriptures, and review 1 Nephi 3:7 and your
answers.

The Prophet Joseph Smith said: “I made this my

rule: When the Lord commands, do it” (in History of the
Church, 2:170). Consider writing this statement in your
scriptures next to 1 Nephi 3:7.

1 Nephi 3:10-31
Laban steals Lehi’s property and tries to kill Nephi and
his brothers

God blesses us in different ways as we obey His
commandments. Nephi’s experience in obtaining

the brass plates supports his testimony that God

does provide a way for His children to fulfill His
commandments (see 1 Nephi 3:7). Use the following
chart to study the first two attempts of Lehi’s sons

to obtain the brass plates. Write the answer to the
questions in the column for each attempt, or you may
complete this assignment in your scripture study journal.
Note: In Nephi’s day, casting lots (see 1 Nephi 3:11)
was a customary way of making a choice. By casting
lots, Nephi and his brothers were seeking the Lord’s
guidance in fulfilling the commandment to obtain
the brass plates (see Proverbs 16:33; Bible Dictionary,
“Lots, Casting of”).

Questions First Attempt Second Attempt
(1 Nephi (1 Nephi 3:21-31)
3:10-18)

1. Who went?

2. What did they
do?

3. How did the
brothers react
after the
attempt failed?

1. After their first attempt to obtain the brass plates

failed, Nephi and his brothers were “exceedingly
sorrowful” (1 Nephi 3:14). Review 1 Nephi 3:15-16, and in your
scripture study journal describe how Nephi’s response to the first
failure was different from his brothers.

2. After pondering the second attempt (see 1 Nephi

3:21-31), answer the following question in your scripture
study journal: In what ways do anger, murmuring, and unbelief
prevent us from hearing God?

1 Nephi 4:1-26
Nephi obtains the brass plates

Identify the questions Laman and Lemuel asked in

1 Nephi 3:31. If you were Nephi, how would you
respond to their questions? Read 1 Nephi 4:1-3,
looking for Nephi’s answers to his brothers’ questions.
Why do you suppose Nephi chose the example of
Moses and the Red Sea in answering their questions?
Write a phrase from Nephi’s response to his brothers
that you find uplifting:

Moses had also faced a seemingly impossible task
when he was told to bring the children of Israel out of
Egypt. Despite repeated attempts, he was unable to
convince Pharaoh to release the Israelites. However,
Moses persisted in doing what the Lord commanded
him, and the Lord provided a way for him to free the
Israelites.

Nephi applied the example of Moses to his personal
circumstances and was confident that God would
also prepare a way for him to somehow obtain the

18

brass plates. As you study the remainder of the
account, look for the results of Nephi’s perseverance
and determination to be obedient in spite of initial
setbacks.

Have you ever needed to do something or felt inspired
to do something and yet not immediately known why,
when, and how? President Harold B. Lee observed
that often in these situations we “want to see the end
from the beginning” before we will follow the Lord’s
direction, and he offered the following counsel: “You
must learn to walk to the edge of the light, and then a
few steps into the darkness; then the light will appear
and show the way before you” (quoted in Boyd K.
Packer, “The Edge of the Light,” BYU Today, Mar.
1991, 23).

Read 1 Nephi 4:4-7, and identify how Nephi stepped
with faith into the darkness (the unknown).

What is significant about the phrase “Nevertheless I
went forth” (1 Nephi 4:7)?

3. In your scripture study journal, describe a situation

in which a young man or woman may be asked to do
something or may be led by the Holy Spirit to do something and
not know beforehand what the outcome will be. Perhaps there is
a time when you went forth in faith without knowing beforehand
how or when God was going to help. If so, make note of the
experience in your journal. You may also want to share it in class.

Nephi learned why, when, and how the Lord would
help him accomplish the commandment to obtain the
plates only after he allowed the Holy Ghost to direct

him and after he decided to go forth in faith. Read
1 Nephi 4:8—26, and notice how the Lord helped him
obtain the brass plates.

4. Inyour scripture study journal, list the reasons the

Spirit gave Nephi for slaying Laban (see 1 Nephi 4:8-13).

5. Answer the following question in your scripture study

journal: What have you learned from Nephi's final efforts
to obtain the brass plates that can help you succeed in the
challenges you face or will face in your life?

When you are faced with moments in your own life
of not knowing the how, why, and when, remember
the principle Nephi’s experience illustrates: When we
exercise faith in God and seek to do what He asks,
even when we cannot see the outcome, He will
lead us by the influence of the Holy Ghost.

Commentary and Background Information
The Command to Kill Laban

The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that it is the Lord
who sets the standard of right and wrong: “God said,
‘Thou shalt not kill’ [Exodus 20:13]; at another time
He said ‘Thou shalt utterly destroy’ [Deuteronomy
20:17]. This is the principle on which the government
of heaven is conducted—by revelation adapted to the
circumstances in which the children of the kingdom
are placed. Whatever God requires is right, no matter
what it is, although we may not see the reason thereof
till long after the events transpire. If we seek first the
kingdom of God, all good things will be added” (in
History of the Church, 5:135).

It may help us understand why the Lord required
Nephi to slay Laban when we consider the following:
The Lord had given Laban at least two opportunities to
willingly part with the brass plates, but Laban “would
not hearken unto the commandments of the Lord”

(1 Nephi 4:11). Laban was a liar and a robber, and he
had sought to murder Laman and have all four of the
sons of Lehi killed, which, under the law of Moses,
was punishable by death (see Exodus 21:14). The Lord
knew it was essential for Lehi and his descendants to
have the scriptural record, even if “one man should
perish” (1 Nephi 4:13) for it to happen.

The brass plates not only blessed the people and
nations of the Book of Mormon but also preserved and
provided teachings of the ancient prophets for our day
when some of the writings were copied onto the gold
plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated
(such as quotations from Isaiah and the allegory of
Zenos). Through the Book of Mormon, those teachings
from the brass plates have blessed and continue to
bless the lives of millions of people and the nations of
the world. Ultimately, all this was at stake when Nephi
stood over Laban and followed the voice of the Spirit.

President Ezra Taft Benson suggested “three short
tests” to help us avoid being deceived during difficult
situations:

“1, What do the standard works have
to say about it? “To the law and to the
_ testimony: if they speak not according to

this word, it is because there is no light in
them,’ said Isaiah. (Isa. 8:20.) ...

“We must diligently study the scriptures.
Of special importance to us are the Book of Mormon
and the Doctrine and Covenants. . . .

“2. The second guide is: what do the latter-day
Presidents of the Church have to say on the subject—
particularly the living President? . ..

“There is only one man on the earth today who speaks
for the Church. (See D&C 132:7; 21:4.) That man is
[the] President [of the Church]. Because he gives

the word of the Lord for us today, his words have an
even more immediate importance than those of the
dead prophets. When speaking under the influence
of the Holy Ghost his words are scripture. (See D&C
68:4.) ...

“The President can speak on any subject he feels is
needful for the Saints. ...

“3. The third and final test is the Holy Ghost—the test
of the Spirit. By that Spirit we ’. .. may know the truth
of all things.’ (Moroni 10:5.) This test can only be fully
effective if one’s channels of communication with God
are clean and virtuous and uncluttered with sin” (in
Conference Report, Oct. 1963, 16-17).

1 Nephi 5-6; 9

Introduction

The prophet Lehi’s wife, Sariah, feared that her sons
would not return from Jerusalem. Lehi comforted her
by expressing his faith in the Lord. When her sons
returned safely with the brass plates, Sariah gained

a stronger witness of God’s hand in directing and
preserving her family. As Lehi studied the brass plates,
he “was filled with the Spirit, and began to prophesy
concerning his seed” (1 Nephi 5:17). As you study this
lesson, think about your personal scripture study and
what you can do to receive the power that comes from
searching the word of God.

1 Nephi 5:1-9
Lehi's sons safely return to their family in the wilderness

The journey to Jerusalem and back probably took
Nephi and his brothers several weeks. Reflect upon a
time when a brother, sister, parent, or someone else you
know left home for a long period of time—such as for
a mission, school, or military service. What concerns or
worries did you have (or what concerns do you think

a parent might have) when separated from loved ones
for a long time? Read 1 Nephi 5:13, and identify the
concerns Sariah expressed to Lehi concerning her sons’
journey back to Jerusalem.

Study 1 Nephi 5:4—6, and look for how Lehi responded
to Sariah’s concerns.

20

1. In your scripture

study journal, restate
in your own words Lehi’s
response to his wife.

Reflect on the following
questions:

e What impresses
you about how Lehi
responded to Sariah’s
concerns?

e How do Lehi’s words
show the faith and
courage gained from
the revelations God
had given him?

7

Restating in Your
Own Words

One way to understand the
scriptures is to restate princi-
ples in your own words. Either
in writing or orally, restating
what you read will help you
better understand the truths
contained in the scriptures. It
also provides an opportunity
for the Spirit of the Lord to
testify of truths.

According to 1 Nephi 5:6, what effect did Lehi’s

testimony have on Sariah?

Two truths we can learn from this experience of
Lehi and Sariah are that the Lord can bless us with
assurances as we follow His inspiration and we can
comfort and strengthen others when we express our

faith in God.

2. In your scripture study journal, describe a time when

you felt God’s comforting assurance during a difficult
time, shared your testimony to comfort and strengthen someone
else, or were comforted and strengthened by someone else’s

words of faith.

Read 1 Nephi 5:7—9, looking for the effect this
experience had on Sariah’s faith.

e What did Sariah learn from this experience?

3. Answer the following question in your scripture study
journal: How is Sariah’s testimony in 1 Nephi 5:8 like

Nephi’s testimony in 1 Nephi 3:7?

1 Nephi 5:10-22
Lehi searches the brass plates

Nephi and his brothers had risked their lives, sacrificed
their family riches, traveled far, and been divinely
protected in their journey to obtain the brass plates. If
you were a member of Lehi’s family, how would their
efforts have influenced your attitude about studying
what was on the brass plates?

After his sons returned safely, Lehi began to search the
contents of the brass plates. Read 1 Nephi 5:11-14, and
underline what the brass plates contained.

Read 1 Nephi 5:17—20, looking for how studying the
brass plates affected Lehi. Based on what you learn

in these verses, how would you finish stating the
following principle? (see 1 Nephi 5:17): As we search
the scriptures, we can be

Elder Robert D. Hales of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles confirmed this truth:

“When we want to speak to God, we pray. And when
we want Him to speak to us, we search the scriptures;
for His words are spoken through His prophets. He
will then teach us as we listen to the promptings of the
Holy Spirit.

“Tf you have not heard His voice speaking to you lately,
return with new eyes and new ears to the scriptures.
They are our spiritual lifeline” (“Holy Scriptures: The
Power of God unto Our Salvation,” Ensign or Liahona,
Nov. 2006, 26-27).

4. Write in your scripture study journal about a time when
you searched the scriptures and felt the Spirit of the Lord.

Read 1 Nephi 5:21—22, and look for why the plates
were “of great worth” to Lehi and his family.

Turn to the hymn “As I Search the Holy Scriptures”
(Hymns, no. 277), and notice the blessings that can
come through searching the scriptures. Reflect upon
your daily reading of the scriptures. How might you
improve in your study of the scriptures?

There is wisdom in studying the scriptures as we
journey through mortality—our wilderness. Remember
that the brass plates were obtained through faith and
sacrifice and that without the brass plates Lehi and
his family would not have received needed blessings
in their journey (see 1 Nephi 5:22). As you search

the scriptures, you can be filled with the Spirit of the

Lord and receive the strength and faith to keep His
commandments.

1 Nephi 6:1-6
Nephi writes to persuade all to come unto Jesus Christ

Choose a book in your home or think of a book you are
familiar with. What do you think the author’s purpose
was in writing that book? How does knowing the
author's purpose help you as you read?

Read 1 Nephi 6:3—-6, and underline Nephi’s purpose in
writing his record. The phrase “the God of Abraham,
and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob” (verse 4)
refers to Jehovah, who is Jesus Christ. Nephi’s purpose
was continued by all those whose writings are found
in the Book of Mormon: One purpose of the Book
of Mormon is to persuade all people to come unto
Jesus Christ.

5. In your scripture study journal, describe how
understanding Nephi's purpose in writing his record will
affect the way you study the Book of Mormon.

1 Nephi 9
Nephi makes two sets of plates

In 1 Nephi 9 (see also chapter 6), Nephi explained that
he was commanded to make two sets of records—
these are known as the small plates and the large
plates of Nephi. The small plates were to contain

the sacred history of his people—the ministry of the
prophets and the revelations of the Lord—and the
large plates were to contain the secular history (see

1 Nephi 9:2-4). Nephi used the phrases “these plates”
and “other plates” to refer to the two sets of plates the

21
Lord commanded him to make. In the margin of your
scriptures by 1 Nephi 9, write a note like the following
to help you remember which set of plates Nephi was
referring to: “these plates” = small plates (sacred); “other
plates” = large plates (secular).

As you study the Book of Mormon you will come to
understand why Nephi kept two sets of records. Nephi
was inspired to make an abridgement, a shortened
version, of his father’s account (found in 1 Nephi
1-8) on the small plates. Nearly 1,000 years later the
prophet Mormon was directed by the Lord to include
the small plates of Nephi with the gold plates (see
Words of Mormon 1:7). Both men did not know why
they were to do what they did (see 1 Nephi 9:5), but
they followed the Lord’s command.

6. As you read 1 Nephi 9 in your personal study, reflect

upon and record in your scripture study journal why it is
important to obey the Lord even when we don't fully understand
His reasons.

1 Nephi 7

Introduction

Nephi’s complete dedication to the Lord is shown in
1 Nephi 7. With his brothers, he obeyed the Lord’s
command to return to Jerusalem and bring Ishmael
and his family with them into the wilderness. On the
return journey into the wilderness, Laman, Lemuel,
and some of Ishmael’s family rebelled against Nephi
and wanted to return to Jerusalem. When they
bound and sought to kill Nephi, he prayed in faith,
was delivered by the Lord, and sincerely forgave
those who had persecuted him. As you study this
lesson, ponder how you can respond faithfully to
commandments and hardships as Nephi did.

22

Nephi and his brothers talking to Ishmael’s family

1 Nephi 7:1-5
The Lord commands Lehi’s sons to return to Jerusalem for
Ishmael and his family

Think about your family, and ponder why families are
important in God’s plan.

Read 1 Nephi 7:1—2, and find out what the Lord
commanded Lehi to have his sons do and why He
wanted them to do it. (It may be helpful to know that
the word seed in 1 Nephi 7:1 refers to children and

posterity.)

One of the truths we learn from these verses is that the
Lord commands us to marry and raise up children
unto Him. As you continue your study of 1 Nephi 7, ask
yourself why marriage and family are important enough
that the Lord would command Nephi and his brothers
to endure the many days of hard travel through the
wilderness to return to Jerusalem.

Read the following statement from “The Family:

A Proclamation to the World,” and identify what
modern-day prophets have declared about the
importance of marriage: “We the First Presidency and
the Council of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, solemnly proclaim
that marriage between a man and a woman is
ordained of God and that the family is central to the
Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children
(Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2010, 129).

a”

You may want to circle the phrase “unto the Lord” in
1 Nephi 7:1. Think about what that phrase means in
our day.

Look for additional insights into raising up children
unto the Lord as you read the following teaching from
“The Family: A Proclamation to the World”:

“We declare that God’s commandment for His children
to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force... .
“... Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children
in love and righteousness, to provide for their physical
and spiritual needs, and to teach them to love and
serve one another, observe the commandments of
God, and be law-abiding citizens wherever they live.
Husbands and wives—mothers and fathers—will be
held accountable before God for the discharge of these
obligations” (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2010, 129).

Read 1 Nephi 7:3-5 to find out how the Lord helped
Lehi’s sons fulfill His commands. How did the Lord
help Ishmael and his family accept the invitation to
join Lehi’s family in the wilderness?

1. Ask your parents, a Church leader, or a teacher to

suggest three ways young people today can prepare for
marriage and raising children “unto the Lord.” Record their
counsel in your scripture study journal.

1 Nephi 7:6-15

Nephi tries to persuade his brethren to continue their

journey into the wilderness

Visualize the
Scriptures

Scripture study may become
more meaningful if you
picture in your mind what is
taking place. Imagine how
you might feel and act if
you were part of the event
described in the scriptures.
This can also help you real-
ize how scripture accounts
may be similar to situations
in your life and prepare you

to apply the truths the scrip-

tures teach.

Read 1 Nephi 7:6-7,
and find out why Laman,
Lemuel, and some of
Ishmael’s family rebelled
during their journey

in the wilderness.
Imagine what it would
be like to be Nephi in
this situation. Think of
what you would say to
Laman and Lemuel and
Ishmael’s family to try
to persuade them to
continue their journey
to the promised land.

Read 1 Nephi 7:8-12,
and identify the
questions Nephi asked

his brothers to try and persuade them to not return
to Jerusalem. What three truths did Nephi say his

brothers had forgotten?

Answer the following in your scripture study journal:

2. How could remembering those three truths have
helped Laman and Lemuel be faithful to the Lord?

3. List 4-5 blessings you have received from the Lord.
How can remembering what the Lord has done for you
help you be faithful in choosing to follow Him?
Read 1 Nephi 7:13-15, and identify what Nephi said
would happen to Laman, Lemuel, and Ishmael’s

rebelling family members if they went back to
Jerusalem.

4. Write a paragraph in your scripture study journal
about why it is essential to remember what the Lord
has done for you and follow His guidance.

1 Nephi 7:16-22
The Lord delivers Nephi

Continue to imagine what it would be like to be in
Nephi’s situation as you read 1 Nephi 7:16. What
would you do?

Nephi prayed. Read his prayer in 1 Nephi 7:17-18,
and identify what Nephi prayed for.

Notice that Nephi asked to be delivered “according
to [his] faith.” One of the lessons we learn from these
verses is that God answers prayers according to our
faith. Praying in faith means to pray with trust in the
Lord and always includes a willingness to act.

Study the following statement from Elder David A.
Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
concerning Nephi’s prayer in 1 Nephi 7:17 and

the power of the Atonement to change our hearts.
Underline any phrases that help you understand the
importance of being willing to act as we pray in faith.

“Do you know what I likely would have
prayed for if l had been tied up by my
brothers? My prayer would have included
a request for something bad to happen to
my brothers and ended with the phrase
‘wilt thou deliver me from the hands of
my brethren’ or, in other words, ‘Please get me out of
this mess, now!’ It is especially interesting to me that
Nephi did not pray, as I probably would have prayed,
to have his circumstances changed. Rather, he prayed
for the strength to change his circumstances. And may
I suggest that he prayed in this manner precisely
because he knew and understood and had experienced
the enabling power of the Atonement of the Savior. .. .

“Brothers and sisters, the implication of this episode for
each of us is quite straightforward. As you and 1 come
to understand and employ the enabling power of the
Atonement in our personal lives, we will pray and seek
for strength to change our circumstances rather than
praying for our circumstances to be changed. We will
become agents who ‘act’ rather than objects that are
‘acted upon’ (2 Nephi 2:14)” (’ In the Strength of the
Lord’ (Words of Mormon 1:14; Mosiah 9:17; Mosiah
10:10; Alma 20:4),” in Brigham Young University 2001-
2002 Speeches [2002], 124).

5. Answer one of the following questions in your
scripture study journal:

personally. Consider how the choices you make affect
your closeness to the Lord and your ability to feel His
love. As you study 1 Nephi 8, look for what it teaches
you to do and what you should avoid to come closer to
the Lord and feel His love more powerfully in your life.

Read 1 Nephi 8:2, and identify what Lehi experienced
while in the wilderness. Read 1 Nephi 8:5-12, looking
for what appears to be the central image or focal point
of Lehi’s dream.

a. When in your life have you prayed with faith and recognized
the Lord’s answer to your prayer?

b. How can you follow Nephi’s example to pray and seek
strength to change your circumstances rather than praying for
your circumstances to be changed?

After Nephi was delivered from his bonds, his brothers
again wanted to attack him. Read 1 Nephi 7:19-21, and
identify what impresses you about Nephi’s attitude.
Think about a situation in your own family that
required forgiveness. Consider why it is so important
that family members be willing to forgive one another.

After identifying the central image, list some of the
words and phrases Lehi used to describe the fruit in
1 Nephi 8:10-11.

Introduction

In 1 Nephi 8 we read about Lehi’s vision of the tree of
life. He felt great joy as he partook of the fruit of the
tree, which symbolizes the blessings of the Atonement.
He then saw various groups of people who responded
differently to the tree and its fruit. To help you prepare
for this lesson, you may want to sing or read the words
to “The Iron Rod” (Hymns, no. 274). As you study this

chapter, ponder how the Atonement has brought you

The First Presidency taught

great joy and what you
must do now and in the
future to receive all of its
blessings. Reflect upon
what obstacles you may
need to overcome to
claim these blessings.

1 Nephi 8:1-18

Lehi partakes of the fruit of
the tree of life and invites
his family to do the same
Think about a time in

your life when you felt
the Lord’s love for you

The Lord often uses objects we are familiar with as
symbols to help us understand eternal truths. To
help you identify what the tree and fruit in Lehi’s
dream represent, read the following statement from
Elder Neal A. Maxwell of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles: “The tree of life . . . is the love of God (see
1 Ne. 11:25). The love of God for His children is
most profoundly expressed in His gift of Jesus as our
Redeemer: ‘God so loved the world, that he gave his
only begotten Son’ (John 3:16). To partake of the love
of God is to partake of Jesus’ Atonement and the
emancipations [freedom from restraint or sin] and
joys which it can bring” (“Lessons from Laman and
Lemuel,” Ensign, Nov. 1999, 8).

To help you identify a gospel principle being illustrated
in 1 Nephi 8:10-12, underline in your scriptures what
Lehi did with the fruit in 1 Nephi 8:11, and underline
the results in 1 Nephi 8:12. Think about ways you
could “partake” of the Atonement like Lehi “partook”
of the fruit.

Lehi’s experience shows that coming to Jesus Christ
and partaking of His Atonement brings happiness
and joy.

1. Answer the following question in your scripture study
journal: When has the Savior's Atonement brought
happiness and joy into your life?

Ponder why we, like Lehi, should desire that our family
and friends experience the blessings of the Atonement
after we have experienced them. Read 1 Nephi 8:3-4,
13-18, and look for how members of Lehi’s family
reacted to Lehi’s invitation to partake of the fruit of the
tree of life.

We cannot decide whether others will choose to
partake of the love of God. However, like Lehi, we can
invite and encourage them. Consider how you could
invite and encourage someone you know to come unto
Christ and receive the blessings of His Atonement.

1 Nephi 8:19-35
Lehi sees the success of some and the failure of others as
they move toward the tree of life and partake of the fruit

Later in 1 Nephi you will read about how Nephi was
also shown the vision of the tree of life. He recorded
what the various symbols and images in the vision
mean. Use the following chart to identify the symbols
and their interpretations. Search your scriptures to
complete the following exercise. You have already
studied and learned the interpretation of the first
two symbols.

Symbol from Lehi's Dream | The Interpretation of the

Symbol Given to Nephi

The tree (see 1 Nephi 8:10;
it is called the tree of life in
1 Nephi 15:22)

The love of God (see 1 Nephi
11:25)

The fruit of the tree (see
1 Nephi 8:10-12)

The greatest of God's
gifts—the blessings of the
Atonement of Jesus Christ
(see 1 Nephi 15:36)

The river of (filthy) ater (see
1 Nephi 8:13)

Symbol from Lehi's Dream | The Interpretation of the

Symbol Given to Nephi

The rod of iron (see 1 Nephi
8:19)

(see 1 Nephi 11:25; 15:23-24)

The mist of darkness (see
1 Nephi 8:23)

(see 1 Nephi 12:17)

The great and spacious
building (see 1 Nephi 8:26)

(see 1 Nephi 11:36; 12:18)

It may be helpful to mark your scriptures by writing
the interpretation of each symbol (the answers in the
second column of the chart above) next to the verse or
verses where the symbol is mentioned (the verses in
the first column of the chart).

As you read the following
quotation from President
Boyd K. Packer of the

Notes written in your scrip-
tures can be more accessible
than information in a journal
or on a piece of paper. Writing
the interpretations of symbols,
cross references, and other
information in your scriptures
can make it easier for you to
understand the scriptures and
teach from them later.

Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles, underline what
he said about why it is
important for us to study
Lehi’s dream:

“You may think that Lehi’s
dream or vision has no
special meaning for you,
but it does. You are in it; all
of us are init....

“Lehi’s dream or vision

of the iron rod has in it everything a Latter-day
Saint needs to understand the test of life” (“Finding
Ourselves in Lehi’s Dream,” Ensign, Aug. 2010, 22).

As you study the remainder of 1 Nephi 8, consider
how what you are learning can help you “understand
the test of life.” Read 1 Nephi 8:21—-33 looking for
how the river, the mist of darkness, and the great
and spacious building prevented the people in Lehi’s
dream from eating or enjoying the fruit of the tree of
life. You might consider marking in your scriptures
key words and phrases that refer to these obstacles
and the effect they had on people.

What might those obstacles Lehi saw be in our lives
today? Underline any of the following obstacles you
have seen prevent someone from coming to the Savior
and feeling joy: pornography, seeking the acceptance

25
or praise of others, addictions, selfishness, greed,
being envious of others, failing to pray and study the
scriptures, excessive use of electronic entertainment,
excessive participation in any activity or sport,
dishonesty, and following what everyone else does.
Think of some other modern-day examples of these
obstacles.

The following gospel principle is one way of
summarizing what you can learn from studying the
obstacles in 1 Nephi 8:21-33: Pride, worldliness,
and submitting to temptations can keep you from
receiving the blessings of the Atonement.

2. In your scripture study journal, write the above
summary and your feelings about its truthfulness and
ways it can be applied in your life.

Ponder how the filthiness of the world, Satan’s
temptations, and the pride of the world may be
preventing or slowing your spiritual progress.

Search 1 Nephi 8:21—33 again. This time look for
answers to the following questions:

¢ How was the iron rod (the word of God—which
includes the scriptures, the inspired words of
prophets and other Church leaders, and personal
revelation) essential to those who successfully
partook of the fruit?

e What phrase in 1 Nephi 8:30 describes what we
must do in order for the word of God to safely lead
us to the tree of life?

3. Write in your scripture study journal how the word
of God can guide and keep us safe from temptation.

These verses teach the following gospel principles:

If we hold fast to the word of God, it will help

us overcome temptation and worldly influences.
Holding fast to the word of God helps us grow
closer to the Lord and receive the blessings of the
Atonement.

4. To help you see evidence of these principles in your
life, answer one or both of the following questions in
your scripture study journal:

a. When has the word of God guided you and kept you safe
from temptation, pride, or worldliness?

b. When has the word of God helped you come closer to the
Savior?

Lehi urged his family “with all the feeling of a tender

parent, that they would hearken to his words” (1 Nephi

8:37). He wanted them to experience the joy and
blessings of the Atonement of Jesus Christ as he did.

26

5. In your scripture study journal, write a goal for
improving your study of God’s word.

As you follow and hold fast to the word of God, you
can overcome obstacles that would prevent you from
partaking of the Atonement and receiving true joy.

1 Nephi 10-11

Introduction

Lehi’s teachings about the tree of life and his prophecies
about the Jews increased Nephi's desire to see, hear, and
know for himself the things his father had seen. While
Nephi was pondering the things his father had said, he
was “caught away in the Spirit of the Lord” (1 Nephi
11:1) and saw the vision of the tree of life for himself.
In his vision he also saw the Savior’s life, ministry, and
death—Nephi witnessed the Savior’s love for us. As
you study this lesson, ponder what you can learn from
Nephi’s example of seeking personal revelation. Also
reflect on the life and mission of the Savior and His
great love for all of us.

1 Nephi 10:1-16
Lehi prophesies

After relating his vision of the tree of life, Lehi
prophesied about future events. His prophecies are
recorded in 1 Nephi 10:1-16. Read 1 Nephi 10:4-6,
and mark the answers to the following questions in
your scriptures:

e When did Lehi prophesy that the Messiah—the
Savior—would come?

e What did Lehi say would happen to those who do
not “rely on this Redeemer”?
1 Nephi 10:17-11:6
Nephi seeks to see, hear, and know the same truths as his
father

Consider the following scenario, and think about how
people involved in the same situation can have such
different experiences: Three young people attended
the same Church meeting. One of them thought the
meeting was boring and a waste of time. Another
thought the meeting was nice but did not learn
anything from it. The third felt uplifted by the Holy
Ghost and received personal inspiration and direction
beyond what was taught in the meeting.

As you study Nephi’s experience in 1 Nephi 10:17—
11:6, notice what Nephi did that allowed him to
receive additional revelation beyond what his father
had taught.

Read 1 Nephi 10:17, and underline what Nephi felt
after hearing about Lehi’s vision.

Read 1 Nephi 10:19, and find a phrase that teaches
how the mysteries of God are revealed to us.

According to 1 Nephi 10:19, those who seek diligently
receive the mysteries of God. Write what you think it
means to diligently seek.

Nephi provided an excellent example of diligently
seeking revelation. Read 1 Nephi 10:17-19 and 11:1-6;
choose two of the three subjects listed in the chart
below—desires, belief, and pondering; and write your
answers to the corresponding questions in the chart.

Desires What did Nephi desire to know?

How do you think our desires affect our
ability to receive revelation?

What do you desire to know from the
Lord?

Belief What are several things Nephi believed in
that led to revelation?

How do you think these beliefs might
affect our ability to receive revelation
today?

Do you believe what the Lord has
revealed to you?

Summarize a gospel principle you have learned from
Nephi’s experience by completing the following
sentence: God reveals truth to all those who

1. Write the answer to one or both of the following
questions in your scripture study journal:

a. When have you felt God answered your prayers or felt
promptings from the Spirit while you were diligently seeking
help or guidance from the Lord?

b. What is one way you can more diligently seek inspiration
from the Lord?

1 Nephi 11:7-36

Nephi witnesses the condescension of Jesus Christ

Nephi continued to ponder and seek divine guidance
during his vision. Read the following statement from
President Boyd K. Packer, President of the Quorum of
the Twelve Apostles, and identify what he said was the
main focus of Nephi’s vision:

“Prophecies concerning the Messiah appear in the Old
Testament. But the Book of Mormon records a vision of
that event which has no equal in the Old Testament.

“After the people of Lehi [left Jerusalem], Lehi had a
vision of the tree of life. His son Nephi prayed to know
its meaning. In answer, he was given a remarkable
vision of Christ.

“In that vision he saw:

“e A virgin bearing a child in her arms,

“e One who should prepare the way—John the
Baptist,

“e The ministry of the Son of God,

“e Twelve others following the Messiah,

“e The heavens open and angels ministering to them,

“e The multitudes blessed and healed,

“e The crucifixion of the Christ,

“e The wisdom and pride of the world opposing his
work. (See 1 Ne. 11:14-36.)

27
“That vision is the central message of the Book of
Mormon” (“The Things of My Soul,” Ensign, May
1986, 60-61).

An angel helped Nephi discover the interpretation

of the tree of life and then asked, “Knowest thou the
meaning of the tree which thy father saw?” (1 Nephi
11:21). Review the meaning of the tree by underlining
the phrases Nephi and the angel used to describe the
tree in 1 Nephi 11:21-24.

Read 1 Nephi 11:16 and underline an earlier question
the angel had asked Nephi. You may wish to write in
your scriptures that the word condescension means to
willingly descend from a position of high status to

help or bless others.

Define Difficult Words

| \4
It is important to define diffi-
cult words as you study the
scriptures. This will help you
have a better understanding
of them. Check the scripture
footnotes, use a dictionary,
or consult with a parent or
teacher if you encounter
words in your study that you
do not understand. It may be
helpful to write the mean-

In 1 Nephi 11:17, identify
Nephi’s answer to the
angel’s question. What
did Nephi know? What
didn’t he know? After
Nephi’s response, the
angel showed him that
the condescension

of Jesus Christ
demonstrates God’s
love for us.

After you have learned
the meaning of the

word condescension, read
1 Nephi 11:13-21, and
then read the following

ing of these words in your
scriptures.

quotation from Elder
Gerald N. Lund, who was then serving as a member of
the Seventy, and ponder how the Savior’s birth shows
His condescension and His love for us: “Here was
Jesus—a member of the Godhead, the Firstborn of the
Father, the Creator, Jehovah of the Old Testament—
now leaving His divine and holy station; divesting
Himself of all that glory and majesty and entering the
body of a tiny infant; helpless, completely dependent
on His mother and earthly father. That He should not
come to the finest of earthly palaces and be swaddled
in purple [a sign of royalty] and showered with jewels
but should come to a lowly stable is astonishing. Little
wonder that the angel should say to Nephi, ‘Behold
the condescension of God!’” (Jesus Christ, Key to the
Plan of Salvation [1991], 16).

2. Write in your scripture study journal what it means to

you that Jesus Christ “would descend from his throne
divine” ("I Stand All Amazed,” Hymns, no. 193) and His glorious
position in the premortal world to be born as a tiny infant.

28

Read 1 Nephi 11:27, and consider how the Savior’s
baptism also shows His condescension. Though He
had no sin, He was baptized to show His obedience to
the laws of God. It also shows His love for us by giving
us an example to follow.

WE

em

Read 1 Nephi 11:28-31, and think about how
Jesus Christ’s life of service to others shows His
condescension. Notice who the Savior ministered
to and healed.

3. Write in your scripture study journal how what you
read in 1 Nephi 11:28-31 shows the Savior's love for His
people. How do you feel this relates to His love for you today?

Read 1 Nephi 11:32-33, and ponder how the
crucifixion of Jesus Christ shows His condescension.
Read the following statement from Elder Earl C.
Tingey, who was then serving as a member of the
Presidency of the Seventy, and look for what he said
about how the Savior’s Atonement shows His love
and blesses you:
“As the one who was chosen to fulfill the requirements
of the Atonement, Jesus Christ condescended . . . to
be tempted, tried, mocked, judged, and crucified, even
though He had power and authority to prevent such
actions.

“President John Taylor described the
condescension of Christ in these beautiful
words: ‘It was further necessary that He
should descend below all things, in order
that He might raise others above all
things . . .’ [The Mediation and Atonement
(1882), 144].

“Christ’s suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane
epitomizes the most magnificent of all the attributes
of Christ, His perfect love. Here we see that He truly
loved all of us. ...

“The Atonement is an event that enables us to be
reconciled to God... . In terms of family, it means to
be reunited with one another and with God and His
Son, Jesus Christ. It means sadness through separation
will become happiness through reuniting” (“The Great
Plan of Happiness,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2006,
73-74).

The Atonement of Jesus Christ was an essential part
of His condescension and the greatest manifestation
of His love for us.

4. Write in your scripture study journal how knowing
about the condescension of Jesus Christ affects your
feelings and love for Him.

End today’s study by singing, listening to, or reading
the words to the hymn “I Stand All Amazed” (Hymns,
no. 193). Notice the phrases that testify of what you
have studied today. Ponder why the blessings of the
Atonement of Jesus Christ are “most desirable” and
“most joyous” to you (see 1 Nephi 11:22-23). Like
Nephi, as you diligently seek understanding through
revelation, you will draw nearer to the Lord and feel
the power of His sacrifice in your life and the joy it
brings.

assignments in your scripture study journal:

with my teacher:

1 Nephi 12-14

Introduction

The account of Nephi’s vision, which begins in

1 Nephi 11, continues in 1 Nephi 12-14. In his vision
Nephi saw terrible tragedies, including the eventual
destruction of his posterity. He saw the wicked remove
plain and precious truths from the Bible, causing many
to stumble spiritually. However, Nephi’s vision also
gave him reason for great hope in the future. He saw
Columbus and the colonizing of America. He saw that
the Lord would prepare the way for the Restoration of
the gospel, including restoring many of the plain and
precious truths that had been lost. Nephi witnessed
how in the last days the Lord would help and protect
those who live righteously. As you study 1 Nephi
12-14, ponder the importance in your life of the plain
and precious truths taught in the Book of Mormon
and other latter-day scriptures. As you strive to live
righteously and honor your covenants with God, you
too can triumph over evil.

1 Nephi 12
Nephi sees the future of the Nephite and Lamanite nations

In 1 Nephi 12, Nephi described what he saw for the
future of his posterity and how they would be affected
by influences represented by the mist of darkness and
the large and spacious building. He used the word seed
to refer to descendants.

Nephi saw that some of his descendants would accept
all of the blessings of the Atonement. However, he
also saw that his descendants would eventually be
destroyed by the Lamanites. Read 1 Nephi 12:19,

and underline the reasons why the Nephites were
destroyed. Think about how you can guard against
pride and avoid the temptations of the devil.

1 Nephi 13:1-9
Nephi sees the great and abominable church

Circle any of the following sports you have played or
watched, and add to the list any other sports you have
played or watched:

Soccer Tennis

Cricket Rugby

Basketball Ice Hockey
Baseball Volleyball

Table Tennis American Football

29
In professional sports, teams often study their
opponents’ past games and strategies before they
compete. Understanding an opponent's purpose,
methods, and strategies can help us prepare to
defend ourselves against them.

In 1 Nephi 13, Nephi described what he saw about those
who would oppose the Church of God in the latter-days.
Read 1 Nephi 13:1—6, and identify what Nephi saw that
would be formed among the Gentiles and what the
angel said about it.

This “great and abominable church” that
Nephi saw does not represent one
particular group, denomination, or church.
Elder Bruce R. McConkie of the Quorum
of the Twelve Apostles defined it as “all
... organizations of whatever name or
nature... which are designed to take men on a course
that leads away from God and his laws and thus from
salvation in the kingdom of God” (Mormon Doctrine,
2nd ed. [1966], 137-38). You may want to write Elder
McConkie’s definition next to 1 Nephi 13:4-6.

Read 1 Nephi 13:8—9, and identify the desires and
motivation of the great and abominable church.

1. Answer the following question in your scripture

study journal: Why do you think it is important to know
that Satan organizes his forces to lead us away from God and
His laws?

As you study 1 Nephi 13 further, you will see one way
the great and abominable church has tried to block
those seeking the Savior.

1 Nephi 13:10-—42
Nephi sees future Gentiles with the Bible, the Book of
Mormon, and other latter-day scriptures

To combat the effects of the great and abominable
church, the Lord prepared the way for the Restoration
of His gospel. In 1 Nephi 13, Nephi foresaw such events

30

as Columbus and the pilgrims coming to the land of
promise because “the Spirit of God... wrought [rested
or worked] upon [them]” (see 1 Nephi 13:12-13). He
also foresaw the American War of Independence—when
“the Gentiles who had gone forth out of captivity”
fought against “their mother Gentiles [who] were
gathered together ... against them,” but they were
“delivered by the power of God out of the hands of

all other nations” (see 1 Nephi 13:16-19).

Read 1 Nephi 13:20—-23, and identify the book that
Nephi saw early gentile colonizers in the land of
promise would carry among them.

Write “the Bible” in your scriptures by 1 Nephi 13:20.
Nephi explained that the Bible would be “of great
worth” to us (1 Nephi 13:23) and that when it was
originally written “it contained the fulness of the gospel
of the Lord” (1 Nephi 13:24). Use 1 Nephi 13:26-27, 29
to fill in the blanks to the following summary:

The great and abominable church removed

“many parts which are and most

; and also many of
the Lord have they taken away” from the Bible

(1 Nephi 13:26). They removed these things to

“ the right ways of the Lord, that they
might the eyes and

the hearts of the children of men” (1 Nephi 13:27).
Because these things are missing, “an exceedingly
great many do ” (1 Nephi 13:29).

Reread the above summary after you have filled in
the blanks.

One of the purposes of the great and abominable
church is to “pervert the right ways of the Lord”

(1 Nephi 13:27) by taking away many of the plain and
precious truths. To “pervert” is to cause to turn aside
or away from something that is right. Think about the
negative consequences of turning aside or turning
away from the “right ways of the Lord.”

Use your scriptures to answer the following questions:

e According to 1 Nephi 13:34, what will the Lord bring
forth because of his mercy? (It may be helpful to
know that the title “the Lamb” refers to the Savior,
Jesus Christ.)

¢ In 1 Nephi 13:35—-36, what did the Savior say would
be hid up to come forth to the Gentiles?

¢ In 1 Nephi 13:36, what did the angel say was
written in the record that was hidden—the Book
of Mormon?

e In addition to the Book of Mormon, what “other
books” might 1 Nephi 13:39 refer to?

Read 1 Nephi 13:40—41, and underline what the Book
of Mormon and these “other books” will make known
unto all people. It is important to notice that we must
come to the Savior “according to the words which shall
be established by the mouth of the Lamb” (1 Nephi
13:41)—the scriptures.

Through this portion of Nephi’s vision, we learn that
the Book of Mormon and latter-day scriptures
restore plain and precious truths that help us know
that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and help us
know how to come unto Him.

2. Write the answer to the following questions in your
scripture study journal:

a. How have the plain and precious truths in the Book of
Mormon and other latter-day scriptures influenced your
testimony of Jesus Christ?

b. How have they helped you understand and live His gospel?

7

Take a moment to
evaluate how well your
scripture study is helping
you come closer to the
Savior.

1 Nephi 14:1-17
Nephi sees the battle
between the great and
abominable church and the
Church of the Lamb of God

In 1 Nephi 14 we
read about a battle
between the great and

abominable church and
the Church of the Lamb of God. Read 1 Nephi 14:10—
13, and identify which side would have more people.
Notice in 1 Nephi 14:12 why the number of people
supporting the Church of the Lamb would be few and
why the great and abominable church was able to
gather together multitudes.

How would you feel if you were outnumbered and
fighting in a war? Read 1 Nephi 14:14, and underline
phrases that identify the help “the saints of the church
of the Lamb” and “the covenant people of the Lord”
will receive as they fight against evil.

An important gospel principle taught in 1 Nephi 14:1-17
is as we live righteously and keep our covenants, the
power of God will help us triumph over evil.

3. Write a short paragraph in your scripture study

journal explaining how being one of ”the covenant
people of the Lord” and being ” armed with righteousness”
(living righteously) have helped you triumph over temptations
that could lead you away from God and His laws.

Nephi saw that in the last days those who support the
great and abominable church will meet “their utter
destruction” (1 Nephi 14:3). You can have confidence
that God’s kingdom will triumph in the last days.

1 Nephi 15

Introduction

In 1 Nephi 15 you will see the contrast between
Nephi’s diligent efforts to receive personal revelation
and the faithless efforts of his brothers. As you study
this chapter, ponder the effort you are making to
receive answers and guidance from the Lord.

1 Nephi 15:1-11
Nephi’s brothers complain that they cannot understand
Lehi’s vision

Many activities require effort on our part before we are
able to enjoy the results. Think of an activity that you
participate in—such as schoolwork, playing a musical
instrument, or athletics—and ponder the relationship
between the effort you put into the activity and the
results that follow. Look for a similar pattern as you
study 1 Nephi 15. Notice how putting forth effort
relates to learning spiritual truths and receiving
revelation from the Lord.

After diligently seeking to understand his father’s vision
and teachings and then receiving his own revelation,
Nephi returned to his father’s tent. There he found his
brothers disputing with each other. Search 1 Nephi
15:1-3, and identify what they were discussing.

In 1 Nephi 15:6—7, underline what troubled Nephi’s
brothers and caused the dispute. According to 1 Nephi

31
15:3, why was it difficult for them to understand Lehi’s
teachings?

Read 1 Nephi 15:8, and underline the question Nephi
asked his brothers. Why is this a logical question for
Nephi to ask after what he had just experienced?

Underline the brothers’ response in 1 Nephi 15:9. The
word for in this verse means because. In other words,
Nephi’s brothers explained, “We haven't asked the
Lord because He doesn’t speak to us.”

1. Imagine you have a friend who doesn’t ask the Lord

for guidance because he or she doesn’t believe He will
answer. Study 1 Nephi 15:11, and ponder the counsel Nephi gave
his brothers about obtaining answers from the Lord. Then, in your
scripture study journal, write a letter encouraging your friend to
ask God in faith. Share Nephi’s counsel and your own feelings
about prayer in the letter.

One gospel principle we can learn from Nephi’s

and his brothers’ actions and experiences is that

if we inquire of the Lord in faith and obey His
commandments, then we will be prepared to
receive greater revelation and guidance from Him.

2. Select one of the questions below, and answer it in
your scripture study journal:
a. What would you say to help a new member of the Church
understand what is required of us in order to be taught and
guided by the Lord?
b. How have your efforts to learn spiritual truths and seek the
Lord’s guidance affected your ability to feel the Spirit and
understand the gospel?

Sometime within the next day, share your answer

to the above assignment with a parent, other family
member, Church leader, or teacher. As you do, invite
the person to share experiences with you about when
he or she put forth effort and faith in seeking Heavenly
Father's help and guidance.

1 Nephi 15:12-20
Nephi explains the scattering and gathering of Israel

Nephi’s brothers were confused about Lehi’s prophecy
and teachings of the olive tree and the Gentiles (see

1 Nephi 15:7; see also 1 Nephi 10:12-15). Nephi
explained that the scattering of the natural branches
of the olive tree symbolized the physical and spiritual
scattering of the house of Israel (God’s covenant
people) because of their disobedience. In their
scattered state they lost the knowledge of the gospel,
as well as their identity as members of the house of

32

Israel. As part of the gathering of the house of Israel in
the latter days, people all over the earth will accept the
restored gospel and realize that they are the covenant
people of the Lord (see 1 Nephi 15:14—15).

Read 1 Nephi 15:14, and mark what scattered Israel
will understand in the latter days.

Nephi taught that those who join the Church are as if
they were grafted “into the true olive-tree” (1 Nephi
15:16). He also said that, like the scattering of the
house of Israel, this grafting or gathering would
happen “by way of the Gentiles” (1 Nephi 15:17). It
may be helpful to understand that “in the scriptures,
Gentiles has several meanings. Sometimes it designates
people of non-Israelite lineage, sometimes people of
non-Jewish lineage, and sometimes nations that are
without the gospel, even though there may be some
Israelite blood among the people. This latter usage

is especially characteristic of the word as used in the
Book of Mormon” (Guide to the Scriptures, “Gentiles,”
scriptures.Ids.org).

The Lord keeps His promises and remembers His
covenants with His children. He desires all of His
children to receive the blessings of the everlasting
gospel (see 1 Nephi 15:18). Your efforts to share the
gospel with friends and family and your commitment
to serve an honorable mission help fulfill Lehi’s

prophecy.

1 Nephi 15:21-36
Nephi answers his brother's questions about Lehi's vision
from his own experience

The remainder of 1 Nephi 15 covers questions Nephi’s
brothers asked him about Lehi’s dream. They asked,
“What meaneth the rod of iron which our father saw,
that led to the tree?” (1 Nephi 15:23.) Read Nephi’s
answer in 1 Nephi 15:24—25, and identify the blessings
promised those who hearken diligently to the word
of God. In the following statements from President
Ezra Taft Benson about the power of the word of God,
underline phrases that are similar to what Nephi
taught:

e “Not only will the word of God lead us to the fruit
which is desirable above all others, but in the word
of God and through it we can find the power to
resist temptation, the power to thwart the work of
Satan and his emissaries.”

e “The word of God .. . has the power to fortify the
Saints and arm them with the Spirit so they can resist
evil, hold fast to the good, and find joy in this life.”

e “Success in righteousness, the power to avoid
deception and resist temptation, guidance in our
daily lives, healing of the soul—these are but a few
of the promises the Lord has given to those who will
come to His word... . However diligent we may be in
other areas, certain blessings are to be found only in
the scriptures, only in coming to the word of the Lord
and holding fast to it as we make our way through
the mists of darkness to the tree of life” (“The Power
of the Word,” Ensign, May 1986, 80, 82).

It is vital that we hold to the word of God through
scripture study, prayer, and listening to inspired
leaders.

3. In your scripture study journal, design a flyer promoting

the word of God. Be sure to include the blessings Nephi
promised to those who hold fast to the word of God. You may also
want to list sources for finding the word of God.

Consider writing the following principle in your
scriptures near 1 Nephi 15:24—25: Studying and
following the word of God daily strengthens us
against Satan’s temptations.

4. To help strengthen your testimony of this principle,
answer one or both of the following questions in your
scripture study journal:

a. What experience related to your personal scripture study has
helped you to know that this principle is true?

b. How can you find out if this principle is true?

In Lehi’s dream, those who held fast to the iron rod
were led safely through the mist of darkness to the tree
of life. In 1 Nephi 15:26, Nephi’s brothers asked him to
explain the meaning of the river that was near the tree

of life. Look in 1 Nephi 15:27-29, and identify what the
river represented.

Read 1 Nephi 15:32-36. Why would Nephi’s brothers
have been troubled by these teachings?

5. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. What parts of Lehi’s dream and Nephi’s interpretation of the
dream show God's love and concern for Nephi’s brothers?

b. How do you see God's love and concern for you in 1 Nephi 15?

1 Nephi 16

Introduction

Feeling the power of Nephi’s words, his brothers
humbled themselves before the Lord. As the family
traveled in the wilderness, the Lord gave them the
Liahona to guide them in their journey. The family
experienced many hardships as they traveled,
including their bows losing their spring and the
breaking of Nephi’s bow, which limited obtaining
food. While most of the family murmured as a result
of this loss, Nephi made a new bow and sought

34

the Lord’s counsel about where to hunt. Studying

1 Nephi 16 provides an opportunity for you to
consider how you might respond to both correction
and affliction. Just as the Lord guided Lehi’s family
through their hardships, He will guide you through
challenges in your life if you humbly seek and follow
His counsel.

1 Nephi 16:1-6
Nephi responds to the murmuring of his brethren

Have you ever seen someone being corrected or
rebuked for misbehavior? How did that person react?

Laman and Lemuel felt rebuked by Nephi when he
taught them that the wicked would be rejected and
not allowed to partake of the tree of life (see 1 Nephi
15:36-16:1). Read 1 Nephi 16:1-2, and underline how
Nephi said some people react to hearing truth when
they are not living it.

The phrase “cutteth them to the very center” means
that it exposes their guilt. What do you think “the
guilty taketh the truth to be hard” means?

1. In your scripture study journal, list a few things you

could do to be obedient even when a truth is hard to hear
and “cutteth [you] to the very center” (1 Nephi 16:2). Why do
you think some youth find it hard to be obedient to certain
truths? Compare your list to what Nephi told Laman and Lemuel
in 1 Nephi 16:3-4.

According to 1 Nephi 16:5, how did Laman and
Lemuel chose to respond to Nephi’s instruction? What
word or phrase in this verse describes what we should
do when a truth cuts us to the very center? Mark the
answers to these questions in your scriptures.

1 Nephi 16:7-33
Lehi's family is guided by the Liahona

Answer the following statements true (T) or false (F)
in this quiz by circling your answers:

T F Nephi married Ishmael’s oldest daughter.

T F Lehi was given a compass-like ball called the
Liahona.

T F The round ball had four spindles that gave
direction to Lehi and his family.

T F After Lehi’s family received the ball, their
journey in the wilderness was easy.

As you study 1 Nephi 16:7-10 and the chapter
summary, review your answers to the first three
questions (see also Alma 37:38). Read 1 Nephi 16:17—
19 to determine if you answered the fourth question
correctly. (The correct answers are at the end of this
lesson.)

Even when we are obedient, we will still experience
trials. Many of the trials we face are not the
consequences of making wrong choices. Rather they
come to us as a natural result of mortal life, but they
give us the opportunity to learn and grow during

our mortal journey, just as the Savior did (see D&C
122:7-8). One of our tests in life is how we respond to
these trials.

Based on Nephi’s description of the ball in 1 Nephi
16:10, how might such a gift be helpful to Lehi and his
family as they journeyed to the promised land? Find
and mark how the Liahona benefited Lehi’s family in
1 Nephi 16:16.

Search 1 Nephi 16:20—22, and identify how some of
Lehi’s family reacted when Nephi broke his bow. Study
1 Nephi 16:23-25, 30-32, looking for Nephi’s reaction
to this trial. How did his reaction affect his family?

2. Answer the following question in your scripture study

journal: What are some things you have learned by
comparing the different reactions of Nephi and his family to the
same trial?

Rather than complaining, Nephi made a new bow and
then sought guidance to know where to find food.
Nephi’s example demonstrates that if we do all we
can and also seek the Lord’s direction, then He will
help us through our difficulties.

During these events, the Lord explained to Lehi how
the Liahona worked. In 1 Nephi 16:26-29, look for
what was required for the Lord to guide Lehi’s family
through the Liahona.

3. Imagine you are teaching a young child about the

Liahona. In your scripture study journal, explain in simple
terms how the Liahona guided Lehi’s family and what they had
to do in order for it to continue guiding them.

4. Answer the following question in your scripture study

journal: How does the Liahona show us that “by small
means the Lord can bring about great things”? (1 Nephi
16:29).
Like Lehi’s people, the Lord has provided you with
many gifts to help you receive personal guidance. Read
the following three statements concerning some of
these gifts, and ponder how each of these gifts from
the Lord is similar to the Liahona.

Patriarchal Blessing

President Thomas S. Monson referred to patriarchal
blessings as a personal Liahona:

“The same Lord who provided a Liahona
to Lehi provides for you and for me today
a rare and valuable gift to give direction to
our lives, to mark the hazards to our
safety, and to chart the way, even safe
passage—not to a promised land, but to
our heavenly home. The gift to which | refer is known
as your patriarchal blessing. Every worthy member of
the Church is entitled to receive such a precious and
priceless treasure. . ..

“... Your blessing is not to be folded neatly and
tucked away. It is not to be framed or published.
Rather, it is to be read. It is to be loved. It is to be
followed. Your patriarchal blessing will see you
through the darkest night. It will guide you through
life’s dangers. . . .Your patriarchal blessing is to you
a personal Liahona to chart your course and guide
your way” (“Your Patriarchal Blessing: A Liahona of
Light,” Ensign, Nov. 1986, 65-66).

35
The Scriptures and the Words of the Prophets

Elder W. Rolfe Kerr, who was then serving
as a member of the Seventy, confirmed
that the words of Christ and His servants
are a spiritual Liahona: “The words of
Christ can be a personal Liahona for each
of us, showing us the way. Let us not be
slothful because of the easiness of the way. Let us in
faith take the words of Christ into our minds and into
our hearts as they are recorded in sacred scripture and
as they are uttered by living prophets, seers, and
revelators. Let us with faith and diligence feast upon
the words of Christ, for the words of Christ will be our
spiritual Liahona telling us all things what we should
do” (“The Words of Christ—Our Spiritual Liahona,”
Ensign or Liahona, May 2004, 37).

The Holy Ghost

Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of
the Twelve Apostles compared the Holy
Ghost and the Liahona: “As we strive to
align our attitudes and actions with
righteousness, then the Holy Ghost
becomes for us today what the Liahona
was for Lehi and his family in their day. The very factors
that caused the Liahona to work for Lehi will likewise
invite the Holy Ghost into our lives. And the very
factors that caused the Liahona not to work anciently
will likewise cause us to withdraw ourselves from the
Holy Ghost today” (“That We May Always Have His
Spirit to Be with Us,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2006, 30).

5. Write in your scripture study journal two or three

ways that a patriarchal blessing, the scriptures and the
words of the prophets, or the Holy Ghost is like the Liahona.

6. In your scripture study journal, describe a time when

following the direction from one of the sources listed
above led to your receiving guidance from the Lord?

1 Nephi 16:34—39
Ishmael's daughters mourn his death, and Laman plots
to kill Lehi and Nephi

In 1 Nephi 16:34—38 we learn that Ishmael died after
traveling many days in the wilderness. His daughters
mourned the loss of their father exceedingly, and some
of his family murmured against Lehi and Nephi and
wanted to return to Jerusalem. Laman even conspired
to murder Nephi and Lehi. Once again Nephi’s
brothers showed their weakness and faithlessness
because they did not seek the will of the Lord. They

36

had rejected the Holy Ghost and the help He would
have given them.

Read 1 Nephi 16:39, and discover what the Lord did in
this situation. From what you learn in this verse, why
does the Lord chasten us?

The Lord guides and chastens us for our benefit. If we
act on the guidance or chastening we receive from the
Lord, He will bless us.

1 Nephi 17

Introduction

After traveling eight years in the wilderness, Lehi’s family
arrived at a place by the seashore. They called the place
Bountiful. Nephi obeyed the Lord’s command to build a
ship. He also rebuked his brothers for their wickedness
that prevented them from receiving inspiration from the
Lord. As you study 1 Nephi 17 and Nephi’s example, you
will see that through obedience you can accomplish all
that God has commanded. You will also learn to better
recognize the Lord speaking to you through the still,
small voice.

1 Nephi 17:1-51
Lehi's family journeys to Bountiful, where Nephi is
commanded to build a ship

Would you describe your life as easy or difficult? Why?
Read 1 Nephi 17:1, 4, 6, and circle words that indicate
whether the time Nephi and his family spent in the
wilderness was easy or difficult.

Read 1 Nephi 17:3, and identify the reason Nephi gave
for why his family was blessed during this difficult
time—it begins with the word if, Mark this principle in
your scriptures.
Learn How to
Identify Principles
and Doctrines

By4
As you study the scriptures
look for words or phrases such
as “thus we see,” “therefore,”
“wherefore,” “behold,” or
“if... then...” They often
indicate when a statement of
doctrine or a gospel principle
is being given.

Gospel principles are
often stated in the
scriptures in an “if-then”
format. This “if-then”
format can also be

seen in the direction

of individual lives, as
well as families and
whole nations. The
word if describes our
action, and then explains
the consequence or
blessing we will receive

for that action. While

1 Nephi 17:3 does not
contain the word then, it does describe an action and
a blessing that will follow. How would you state the
principle Nephi is testifying of in your own words? If

, then

Notice how this principle is illustrated in 1 Nephi

17:2, 12-13. As you read these verses, mark some ways
the Lord strengthened and blessed Nephi and his
family when they kept the commandments. Look for
additional evidence of the truth of this principle as you
continue to study Nephi’s experience.

1. Take time to meaningfully answer the following

questions in your scripture study journal. This exercise
will help you see that Nephi continued to live the principle he
stated in 1 Nephi 17:3, while other family members failed to
live it. Remember to think about how this principle applies to
your own life.

a. What did the Lord command Nephi to do? (See 1 Nephi
17:7-8.) What may have been difficult about obeying this
commandment?

b. What impresses you about Nephi’s response to this
commandment? (See 1 Nephi 17:9-11, 15-16). How did his
brothers respond? (See 1 Nephi 17:17—21.) What can you learn
from these responses.

c. Nephi replied to his brothers by recalling the experience of
Moses. How did the Lord help Moses accomplish the task he was
commanded to do? (See 1 Nephi 17:23-29.) How were Nephi’s
brothers like the children of Israel? (See 1 Nephi 17:30, 42.)

d. Are there some commandments that are difficult for you?

How can you respond to difficult tasks or commandments from
God as Nephi and Moses did?

When you have finished the assignment above, read
Nephi’s expression of faith in 1 Nephi 17:50.

Read 1 Nephi 17:51, and apply this verse to yourself by
adding your name after the word “me” and replacing
the phrase “build a ship” with a commandment you
noted in question d above.

2. In your scripture study journal, write about an

experience (your own or that of someone you know) that
helped you to know that if you are faithful to God, He will help
you accomplish whatever He asks of you.

The principle Nephi exemplified in 1 Nephi 17
and throughout his life is that if we keep the
commandments, then the Lord will strengthen
us and provide means for us to accomplish that
which He has commanded.

1 Nephi 17:45-55

Nephi rebukes his brethren for their wickedness

Read 1 Nephi 17:48, 53-54, and identify why Nephi
“stretched forth [his] hand unto [his] brethren.”

According to 1 Nephi 17:53, what did the Lord do to
Nephi’s brothers? Why?

The shock given to Nephi’s brothers was one of many
ways the Lord had sought to communicate with them.
Read 1 Nephi 17:45, and identify some other ways the
Lord had tried to communicate with them.

37
Ponder the following quotation from
President Boyd K. Packer of the Quorum
of the Twelve Apostles: “The Holy Ghost
speaks with a voice that you feel more
than you hear. It is described as a ‘still
small voice’ [D&C 85:6]. And while we
speak of ‘listening’ to the whisperings of the Spirit,
most often one describes a spiritual prompting by
saying, ‘Ihad a feeling...’” (“Personal Revelation: The
Gift, the Test, and the Promise,” Ensign, Nov. 1994, 60).

You may want to mark 1 Nephi 17:45 and write

the following principle next to it: The Holy Ghost
speaks with a still, small voice that we feel more
than we hear.

3. Write answers to the following questions in your
scripture study journal:
a. When have you fe/t the Lord speak through a still, small
voice?

b. What can you do to feel and recognize the still, small voice?

Mark the following phrase in 1 Nephi 17:45: “he hath
spoken unto you in a still small voice, but ye were past
feeling, that ye could not feel his words.” Look again
at the first sentence of 1 Nephi 17:45, and identify

a reason why Nephi’s brothers had become “past
feeling.”

How can sin prevent us from feeling the Holy Ghost?
What other kinds of things can distract us from feeling
the Holy Ghost?

President James E. Faust of the First Presidency used
an analogy to identify some ways sin can prevent us
from feeling the Holy Ghost:

“Cellular phones are used for much of the
- communication in our time. Occasionally,
however, we find dead spots where the
signal coming to a cell phone fails. This
can happen when the cell phone user is in
a tunnel or a canyon or when there is
other interference.

“So it is with divine communication. .. .We often put
ourselves in spiritual dead spots—places and situations
that block out divine messages. Some of these dead
spots include anger, pornography, transgression,
selfishness, and other situations that offend the Spirit”
("Did You Get the Right Message?” Ensign or Liahona,
May 2004, 67).

38

4. Ponder how well you have listened to the messages

the Lord has sought to communicate to you recently. List
in your scripture study journal any “spiritual dead spots” —
situations and places that can prevent you from receiving the
still, small voice—and what you will do to avoid them.

You can receive communication from the Lord through
the still, small voice as you seek to be worthy of and
pay attention to these gentle promptings.

1 Nephi 18-19

Introduction

Following the Lord’s directions, Nephi and his family
finished building the ship and set sail for the promised
land. During their voyage, many on the ship, led by
Laman and Lemuel, rebelled. As a result, the Liahona
ceased to work and a great storm threatened the lives
of everyone onboard. After the rebellious repented
and Nephi prayed in faith, the Liahona began to work
and the Lord calmed the storm and again directed
their journey. After arriving in the promised land,
Nephi exhorted his family to remember the Savior
and to liken the scriptures to themselves. As you study
1 Nephi 18-19, liken Nephi’s experience of facing trials
to the challenges of facing your own trials. Seek to
follow Nephi’s example.

1 Nephi 18:1-8

Lehi's family prepares to sail to the promised land

Why is it important to both work diligently and seek
direction from the Lord? How did Nephi demonstrate

both of these qualities when building the ship? Read
1 Nephi 18:1-8.
1. In your scripture study journal, list all of the words

and phrases in 1 Nephi 18:1-8 that describe the effort
put forth by Nephi and his family. Then identify all the words and
phrases that show how the Lord directed and helped them. What
relationship do you see between Nephi’s effort and the help he
received from the Lord?

Nephi’s experience shows us that in order to
accomplish what the Lord commands, we need
to seek His help and put forth our own effort.

2. Think of a situation you are in now where you need

God's help. Write in your scripture study journal what you
can do to seek the Lord's direction and what effort you may need
to make.

1 Nephi 18:8-25
Laman and Lemuel lead a rebellion on the ship that hinders
the voyage to the promised land

When we experience trials or hardships in life, it is
common to wonder why we are facing such difficulties.
Perhaps you or someone you know has asked “Why?”
during a difficult time.

Elder L. Whitney Clayton of the Presidency of the
Seventy identified three sources for the hardships
we experience. As you read, underline the sources he
describes.

“Tn a general sense, our burdens come
from three sources. Some burdens are the
natural product of the conditions of the
world in which we live. Illness, physical
disability, hurricanes, and earthquakes
come from time to time through no fault
of our own....

“Other burdens are imposed on us by the misconduct
of others. Abuse and addictions can make home
anything but a heaven on earth for innocent family
members. Sin, incorrect traditions, repression, and
crime scatter burdened victims along the pathways of
life. Even less-serious misdeeds such as gossip and
unkindness can cause others genuine suffering.

“Our own mistakes and shortcomings produce many
of our problems and can place heavy burdens on our
own shoulders. The most onerous [difficult] burden
we impose upon ourselves is the burden of sin. We
have all known the remorse and pain which inevitably
follow our failure to keep the commandments” (“That
Your Burdens May Be Light,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov.
2009, 12-13).

After Nephi and his family began to sail to the
promised land, they experienced many difficulties.

As you study 1 Nephi 18, look for one of the types

of suffering Elder Clayton discussed. Read 1 Nephi
18:9-11, and identify examples of wrong choices made
by some of the people on the ship.

While it is not wrong to dance, listen to music, or have
fun, 1 Nephi 18:9 indicates that they did these things
“with much rudeness.” The word rude means to be
harsh, vulgar, or coarse. Satan can use dancing, music,
or the way we speak to corrupt our hearts and minds,
causing us to lose the companionship of the Holy
Ghost.

According to 1 Nephi 18:10, what did Nephi fear
would happen if those who were rebelling did not
repent?

39
What did Nephi do about it? How would you respond
if a parent or Church leader asked you to change the
music you listen to, the way you dance, or to refrain
from using foul language? Would you be willing to
listen and to change?

Read 1 Nephi 18:12-14, 17-19, and look for the

consequences of their rebellion. How did Nephi and
other family members suffer as a result of the actions
of others? Notice how the rebellious actions of some

affected the entire group’s ability to receive guidance
from God.

The actions of those who rebelled show us that sin
leads to suffering for ourselves and sometimes for
others as well.

3. Some common temptations teenagers face today

include being disrespectful to parents and leaders,
cheating in school, gossiping, dressing immodestly, breaking the
law of chastity, breaking the Word of Wisdom (tobacco, alcohol,
and drugs), and viewing pornography. Select two or more of those
temptations, and write in your scripture study journal how each

40

might affect the family and friends of someone who gives in to
the temptation.

The rest of 1 Nephi 18 teaches us how to respond
when hardships come, whether they come from
making bad choices or through no fault of our own.
Read 1 Nephi 18:15—-16, 20-23, and mark phrases that
teach what to do in either situation.

There are several doctrines and principles illustrated
in these verses. After each of the following statements,
write the number of the verse or verses from 1 Nephi
18:15—-16, 20-23 that you feel show an example of that
truth:

¢ We can look to God and remain faithful during
our trials.

¢ Prayer can help us find peace during our trials.

4. Choose one of the verses you used in the preceding

exercise that is especially meaningful to you, and explain
in your scripture study journal why you like it. Include what you
learned from the verse and what it taught you about responding to
afflictions. If you have seen an example of what this verse teaches
in your own or someone else’s life, write about that as well.

In spite of the hardships they faced, Nephi and his
family eventually reached the promised land. As you
seek the Lord’s direction and work diligently to follow
it, you too can successfully complete the journey the
Lord sent you to earth to fulfill.

Elder L. Whitney Clayton offered this testimony:

“No matter the burdens we face in life as a
consequence of natural conditions, the misconduct

of others, or our own mistakes and shortcomings, we
are all children of a loving Heavenly Father, who sent
us to earth as part of His eternal plan for our growth
and progress. Our unique individual experiences can
help us prepare to return to Him. The adversity and
afflictions that are ours, however difficult to bear, last,
from heaven’s perspective, for ‘but a small moment;
and then, if [we] endure it well, God shall exalt [us] on
high’ [D&C 121:7-8]. We must do everything we can
to bear our burdens ‘well’ for however long our ‘small
moment’ carrying them lasts... .

“... know that as we keep the commandments of
God and our covenants, He helps us with our burdens.
He strengthens us. When we repent, He forgives us
and blesses us with peace of conscience and joy”
(“That Your Burdens May Be Light,” 13-14).
1 Nephi 19

Nephi records prophecies concerning Jesus Christ to
persuade us to remember Him

After arriving in the promised land, Nephi prophesied
concerning the coming of the Savior and how He
would be received by His people. Read 1 Nephi 19:8—

1 Nephi 20-22

Introduction

In 1 Nephi 20-21, Nephi quoted prophecies of the
Old Testament prophet Isaiah, whose writings were
contained on the brass plates Nephi and his brothers
had been sent back to Jerusalem to obtain from
Laban. Isaiah taught that even when ancient Israel
did not keep their covenants, the Lord still loved
them and invited them to repent and come unto
Him. As you study these chapters, focus on what
Isaiah taught about Jesus Christ and His desire to
redeem His people.

1 Nephi 20

The Lord chastises Israel and invites them to return to Him

Can you think of a time when you did something that

was not consistent with the covenants you have made

or with the standards of the Church? How did you feel
about your decision? Read 1 Nephi 20:1-2 (to “stay” in
verse 2 means to rely upon). Who was Isaiah speaking
to? Who is the “house of Jacob”?

In the Old Testament, Jacob was the son of Isaac and
the grandson of Abraham. He was given the name
Israel by the Lord (see Genesis 32:28). “The house

of Israel” refers to his descendants and is sometimes
called the “house of Jacob.” It also refers to any true
believers in Jesus Christ. (See Bible Dictionary, “Israel”;
see also Bible Dictionary, “Israel, Kingdom of.”) Just

as in ancient times, those who make covenants (such
as baptism) with God today are considered covenant
members of the house of Israel.

Search 1 Nephi 20:3-4, 8, 18, and underline words or
phrases that indicate the house of Israel had not been
faithful to the Lord. The phrase “thy neck is an iron
sinew, and thy brow brass” (1 Nephi 20:4) symbolically
represents a condition the scriptures repeatedly call
“stiffneckedness.” One possible explanation of this
phrase is that animals such as oxen and donkeys

41
stiffen their necks so that they cannot be guided or led
by their masters. Another explanation is that people
who are not willing to bow their heads are stiffnecked.
Similarly, the house of Israel stiffened their necks
through pride and wickedness and refused to be

guided by the Lord.

To better understand these verses and liken them to
our day, think about how these descriptions of the
house of Israel describe the actions of some people

today.

As you read 1 Nephi 20:9-14, 16, ponder what these
verses teach about the Lord and what He is like.

1. Write short answers to the following questions in
your scripture study journal:

a. Though the people had been rebellious in the past, how did
the Lord respond to them? Why? (See 1 Nephi 20:9-11, 14.)

b. What did the Lord want His covenant people to do? (See

1 Nephi 20:12, 16.)

Pondering

| 4
President Henry B. Eyring

of the First Presidency
taught: “Reading, study-
ing, and pondering are not
the same. We read words
and we may get ideas. We
study and we may discover
patterns and connections

in scripture. But when we
ponder, we invite revelation
by the Spirit. Pondering, to
me, is the thinking and the
praying | do after reading
and studying the scriptures
carefully” (“Serve with the
Spirit,” Ensign or Liahona,
Nov. 2010, 60). Studying the
scriptures in a quiet place
where you can ponder them
will help you feel the influ-
ence of the Holy Ghost.

From these verses we
learn that the Lord
invites those who have
been disobedient to
repent and return to
Him. As you read the
following statement
from President Dieter F.
Uchtdorf of the First
Presidency, underline
one or more phrases that
confirm this truth:

“(Satan] wants us

to feel that we are
beyond forgiveness (see
Revelation 12:10). Satan
wants us to think that
when we have sinned we
have gone past a ‘point
of no return’—that it is
too late to change our
course. ...

“Christ came to save us.
If we have taken a wrong

course, the Atonement of Jesus Christ can give us the
assurance that sin is not a point of no return. A safe

return is possible if we will follow God’s plan for our
salvation” (“Point of Safe Return,” Ensign or Liahona,

May 2007, 99).

1 Nephi 21:1-17
Isaiah prophesies that the Messiah will not forget His
covenant people

In 1 Nephi 21:1-13, Nephi recorded one of Isaiah’s
prophecies about Jesus Christ, who would be the
Messiah. Christ (a Greek word) and Messiah (a
Hebrew word) both mean “the Anointed” or “the
Chosen One.” Jesus Christ was chosen to be the
Redeemer of both Israel and the Gentiles.

As you read 1 Nephi 21:6-13, mark in your scriptures
those phrases that describe Jesus Christ and what He
would do as the Redeemer of Israel.

As a consequence of their sins, the children of Israel
had distanced themselves from the Lord and felt
forgotten and forsaken by Him (see 1 Nephi 21:14).
Although they felt forsaken by the Lord, search

1 Nephi 21:14-16 for evidence that the Lord loves us,
and He will never forget us. You may want to mark
any phrases in these verses that are meaningful to you.

Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles explained how the Savior retained the
wounds of His crucifixion as evidence that He would
never forget us: “Christ will not forget the children he
has redeemed or the covenant he has made with them
for salvation in Zion. The painful reminders of [His]
watch care and covenant are the marks of the Roman
nails graven upon the palms of his hands” (Christ and
the New Covenant [1997], 84).

2. Write short answers to the following questions in
your scripture study journal:

a. Why do you think people sometimes feel that the Lord has
forgotten them?

b. What do you think it means to be graven upon the palms
of the Savior’s hands? How does this help you appreciate the
Savior's suffering on the cross?

c. What experiences have helped you know that the Lord has
not forgotten you?

3. Imagine that you have a friend who said that he or

she no longer feels worthy to attend church because of
past sins. In your scripture study journal, write a short letter of
encouragement to the friend, using what you have learned from
1 Nephi 20-21 and President Uchtdorf's statement in the study
section for 1 Nephi 20.
1 Nephi 21:18—22:22
Nephi explains Isaiah's prophecy of the scattering and
gathering of Israel

Nephi included one of Isaiah’s prophecies about the
gathering of Israel in his record. It is found in 1 Nephi
21:18-26. In 1 Nephi 22, Nephi provided his own
explanation and commentary on Isaiah’s prophecy. As
you read 1 Nephi 22:4—12, look for Nephi’s explanation
of how Israel will be gathered in the last days.

It may help to know that in the Book of Mormon the
term “Gentiles” often refers to people who are not
descendants of Judah. The phrase “a marvelous work”
refers to the latter-day Restoration of the gospel. Also
notice how often Nephi mentions covenants—you
may want to mark these in your scriptures.

The Lord promised to restore the gospel and gather
Israel in the last days. Mark in your scriptures what
will happen to Satan because of the righteousness of
the people as you study 1 Nephi 22:17, 19-22, 25-28.

INTRODUCTION TO
2 Nephi

Why Study This Book?

The book of 2 Nephi will help you understand basic
gospel doctrines, such as the Fall of Adam and

Eve, the Atonement of Jesus Christ, and agency.
Additionally, this book is filled with prophecies from
Nephi, Jacob, and Isaiah, who were special witnesses
of the Savior. They prophesied of the Restoration

of the gospel in the latter days, the gathering of
God’s covenant people, the Second Coming of Jesus
Christ, and the Millennium. The book of 2 Nephi also
contains Nephi’s explanation of the doctrine of Christ
and concludes with Nephi’s testimony of the Savior.

Who Wrote This Book?

Nephi, the son of Lehi, wrote 2 Nephi. Nephi was

a prophet and the first great leader of the Nephite
people. His writings reveal that he experienced the
Lord’s redeeming power (see 2 Nephi 4:15-35; 33:6)
and desired with his whole soul to bring salvation
to his people (see 2 Nephi 33:3-4). To accomplish
this purpose, he established a temple and taught his
people to believe in Jesus Christ.

When and Where Was It Written?

Nephi began writing the account that became

2 Nephi in approximately 570 8.c—30 years after he
and his family left Jerusalem (see 2 Nephi 5:28-31).
He wrote it when he was in the land of Nephi (see
2 Nephi 5:8, 28-34).

2 Nephi 1

Introduction

As you study 2 Nephi 1, notice that it contains the
words of a loving parent and priesthood leader who
was about to die. Father Lehi pled with his family
to obey the commandments of God (see 2 Nephi
1:16). He prophesied that if they would obey the
commandments of God, they would prosper in the
promised land. He also exhorted his children and
those who came with them from Jerusalem to follow

44

Nephi’s prophetic leadership. As you study this
chapter, evaluate your personal obedience to the Lord’s
commandments. How well do you follow the counsel
of Church leaders?

2 Nephi 1:1-23
Lehi exhorts his people to live righteously

Imagine that you suddenly have to leave your
family and never see them again. You have one last
opportunity to speak to them. What might you say
to them in this situation?

In 2 Nephi 1-4, Nephi recorded his father’s final
counsel to his family. As you study these chapters,
think of ways Lehi’s final recorded teachings apply
to you.

Read 2 Nephi 1:1—4, and identify what “great things
the Lord had done” for Lehi’s family.

1. Write short answers to the following questions in
your scripture journal:

a. In what ways did the Lord show mercy to Lehi’s family?
b. What “great things” has the Lord done for you and your

family? What feelings do you have for the Lord when you think
about how merciful He has been to you and your family?

Lehi taught his family that choosing to keep God’s
commandments would determine whether or not
they would continue to receive “great things” and
the “mercies of God” in their lives.

journal: How is repentance like each of the phrases in
the above exercise?

Read 2 Nephi 1:15, and mark in your scriptures the
three phrases Lehi used to describe the blessings
he received because of his obedience to God’s
commandments. Contrast these blessings with the
negative consequences in 2 Nephi 1:17-18, 22 that
Lehi said will come upon those who do not keep
God’s commandments.

Mark Lehi’s counsel in 2 Nephi 1:23, and ponder what

you need to do in your life in order to “awake” or “shake
off” or “arise” so you can receive the blessings that Lehi

spoke of in this chapter.

2 Nephi 1:24-32

Lehi exhorts his sons to follow Nephi's prophetic leadership

Lehi next reminded his family and others of another
source of direction and inspiration they had been

blessed with to help them make righteous decisions in
their lives. Read 2 Nephi 1:24, and identify this source.

As you read 2 Nephi 1:24-27, look for how Lehi
encouraged his people to follow Nephi. Think about
your answers to the following questions:

e What qualities did Lehi emphasize that would help
you trust Nephi as a leader?

e Why would you trust a leader with these qualities?

¢ How have you seen Church leaders today
demonstrate these same qualities?

Read 2 Nephi 1:28-32, and mark in your scriptures
the promises Lehi gave to those who would follow
Nephi’s leadership. These promises show that as we
follow those whom God has called to lead us, we
are blessed with spiritual prosperity and security.
Ponder what Church leaders have taught you recently
about how obedience to inspired counsel can lead to
your spiritual prosperity and security.

Read the following quotation by
President Wilford Woodruff, and
underline the promises he made if we will
follow the counsel of the Lord’s servants:
“T hope we may all pursue the course laid
down for us by the servants of the Lord,
for if we do this I know that we shall be safe in this
world, and secure happiness and exaltation in the
world to come. .. . If we are faithful they will lead us
in the way of life, and in as much as we have faith to
believe in their instructions, in the teachings of the
Holy Spirit through them, we are always in the safe
path, and shall be sure of our reward” (Teachings of
Presidents of the Church: Wilford Woodruff [2004], 199).

obedient to the Lord's commandments and the counsel
of His servants is important to do throughout your life.

2 Nephi 2

Introduction

In 2 Nephi 2, Lehi taught his son Jacob why Heavenly
Father has placed His children in a world where
afflictions, sorrow, sin, and death exist. To help Jacob
understand the purpose of mortality, he explained
fundamental doctrines of the plan of redemption—
including agency, the Fall of Adam, and the Atonement
of Jesus Christ. Studying the truths taught in 2 Nephi 2
can help you more fully appreciate how the Atonement
of Jesus Christ overcomes the effects of the Fall and
makes it possible for each of us to make choices that
will lead to eternal life.

2 Nephi 2:1-25
Lehi teaches about the Fall of Adam and the Atonement
of Jesus Christ

Think about some of the challenges you have faced
lately. Have you ever wondered why life has such

46

challenges? As you read 2 Nephi 2:1, you might want
to mark words or phrases that Lehi used to describe
Jacob’s early years. Then read 2 Nephi 2:2, and mark
what Lehi promised Jacob would result from his
afflictions. One meaning of the word consecrate is to
dedicate or make holy. Lehi seems to be promising
Jacob that the Lord will dedicate Jacob’s trials for his
ultimate benefit.

Lehi taught Jacob about the necessity of the Fall of
Adam and our need for the Atonement of Jesus Christ
in Heavenly Father's plan. He wanted Jacob to know
that the Fall and the Atonement make it possible for
us to exercise our agency so that we can grow and
progress toward eternal life. Read 2 Nephi 2:15-18,
and write short answers to the following questions:

e What did God provide for Adam and Eve in the
Garden of Eden that allowed them to use their
agency? (See 2 Nephi 2:15-16.)

e What was Satan seeking in the Garden of Eden?
(See 2 Nephi 2:17-18.) How do you see Satan
pursuing that same purpose today?

1. Draw the chart below in your scripture journal. Search

2 Nephi 2:19-25, and identify what the consequences
would have been if Adam and Eve had not eaten the forbidden
fruit and fallen, as well as the consequences that occurred
because of the Fall.

If Adam and Eve had not
fallen (2 Nephi 2:22-23)

Because Adam and Eve fell
(2 Nephi 2:19-20, 25)

After completing the chart, consider why the Fall of
Adam and Eve is an essential part of Heavenly
Father’s plan of happiness.

2. Suppose a friend tells you that Adam and Eve made a

mistake by partaking of the forbidden fruit. Using what
you have learned in 2 Nephi 2:19-25, write a paragraph in your
scripture journal explaining why the Fall was essential to
Heavenly Father's plan for our salvation.

You will be asked to explain

and Eve opened the
way for us to progress,
it also introduced other
consequences. Before
the Fall, Adam and Eve
were in the presence of
God in the Garden of
Eden; after partaking
of the forbidden fruit,
they had to leave His
presence.

Read 2 Nephi 2:5, and
identify the phrase that
indicates Adam and Eve’s
separation from God
after the Fall. “Temporal
law” refers to the physical
laws that came into effect

as a result of the Fall. Thus, to be “cut off” according to
the “temporal law” refers to the mortal condition on
earth that we inherit as descendants of Adam and Eve.
Because of these laws we are physically separated from
the presence of God and are subject to sorrows, pains,
afflictions, and physical death. To be “cut off” according
to the “spiritual law” refers to being separated from the
presence of God because of our sins.

Ponder how you have personally experienced these
consequences of the Fall by reflecting on the following
questions:

e What afflictions, pains, and sorrows have you
experienced in this life?

¢ Who do you know who has died? How has this
person’s death affected you?

e When have you felt spiritually separated from God?

As you read 2 Nephi 2:6-10, you might want to mark
key words or phrases that show that through the
Atonement, Jesus Christ redeems us from the
effects of the Fall and offers redemption from our
sins. In 2 Nephi 2:9-10, the word intercession means to
act for the benefit of another.

CL) Scripture Mastery—2 Nephi 2:25

While Lehi was teaching Jacob about the Fall of Adam
and the opposition that we experience in mortality, he
emphasized the positive outcomes of the Fall for all
mankind.

3. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. From what you have learned about the Fall, how does it bring
joy to mankind?

b. When have you experienced joy because of the positive
consequences of the Fall?

2 Nephi 2:11-18, 26-30

Lehi teaches about agency and the consequences of our
choices

Think about an important choice you had to make
recently and what the long-term consequences of
that choice might be. Lehi taught his people the
fundamental importance of agency in Heavenly
Father’s plan of salvation. To help you understand
that we are free to choose liberty and eternal life
or captivity and death (see 2 Nephi 2:27), complete
the activity below.

4. Write each of the following statements taken from

For the Strength of Youth ([booklet, 2011], 2-3) in your
scripture journal. Then, as you read each verse in 2 Nephi 2:11—
18, 26-29, pause and write that verse number after the
statement or statements you think it supports. Each of the verse
numbers should be written after one of the statements. A
statement may apply to more than one verse, and a verse may
relate to more than one statement. As an example, a verse is
written in for the first statement—one truth Lehi taught in
2 Nephi 2:16 is that we have been given the ability to act for
ourselves.

47
a. “Heavenly Father has given you agency, the ability to choose
right from wrong and to act for yourself.” 2 Nephi 2:16

b. “While here on earth, you are being proven to see if you will
use your agency to show your love for God by keeping His
commandments.”

c. “While you are free to choose your course of action, you are
not free to choose the consequences.”

d. “Sinful... choices delay your progression and lead to
heartache and misery.”

e. “Righteous choices lead to lasting happiness and eternal life.”

Read 2 Nephi 2:26-27. What are you free to choose?
Read 2 Nephi 2:28, and mark what else God has given
you to help you “choose eternal life.” Ponder the
choices you have made in your own life that show you
have chosen eternal life.

bring about the Restoration of the gospel. As you
continue to study 2 Nephi 3, look for additional truths
about the Prophet Joseph Smith that can strengthen
your testimony of his divine mission and add them to
yout list.

To help you understand Joseph of Egypt’s prophecy
better, note how often the word seer occurs in 2 Nephi
3:6-7, 11, and 14. You may wish to make a note in
your margin beside one of these verses that a seer is

a person who can know of things past, present, and
future (see Mosiah 8:13-17).

In 2 Nephi 3:7, Joseph of Egypt said that the Lord told
him that Joseph Smith would “do a work .. . which
shall be of great worth” to his descendants. Search

2 Nephi 3:11-15, 19-21 looking for what work “of
great worth” the Lord would accomplish through

the Prophet Joseph. The study aids that are available
to you (chapter summaries, footnotes, Guide to the
Scriptures, and such) can help you understand many
of the details Joseph of Egypt referred to. As you find
new information about the role of the Prophet Joseph
Smith, add it to the list in your scripture journal.

When the scriptures refer to “the fruit of [someone’s]
loins,” they are referring to that person’s descendants.
Joseph of Egypt prophesied that the Prophet Joseph
Smith, one of his descendants, would bring forth the
Book of Mormon in the latter days.

In 2 Nephi 3:12, the phrase “the fruit of thy loins
[Joseph of Egypt’s descendants] shall write” refers to
the written scriptural record—the Book of Mormon—
made by the descendants of Joseph (see 2 Nephi 3:4).
It was prophesied that the Book of Mormon would
“srow together” with the Bible, a sacred record written
by “the fruit of the loins of Judah.” Search 2 Nephi
3:12 for phrases that describe the impact the Book of
Mormon and Bible would have on the world as they
grew together.

Joseph of Egypt also prophesied that the Prophet
Joseph Smith would play an important role in
Heavenly Father’s plan to “bring my people unto
salvation” (2 Nephi 3:15).

2. Answer the following questions in your scripture
journal to help you continue to expand your appreciation
for Joseph Smith's role in Heavenly Father's plan of salvation:

a. What are some examples of covenants, authority, or
ordinances that were restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith
that can help bring people salvation?

b. What differences have these blessings made in your life?

Look for words or phrases that describe the Prophet
Joseph Smith in 2 Nephi 3:24, and add them to the
list in your scripture journal. As you read the following
quotation from President Gordon B. Hinckley, add

to your list any additional teachings of the Prophet
Joseph Smith that confirm he was “an instrument in
the hands of God”:

“Permit me to name a few of many doctrines and
practices which distinguish us from all other churches,
and all of which have come of revelation to the
youthful Prophet [Joseph Smith]. ...

“The first of these, of course, is the manifestation of
God Himself and His beloved Son, the risen Lord Jesus
Christ....

“This knowledge of Deity, hidden from the world for
centuries, was the first and great thing which God
revealed to his chosen servant. . . .

“The Book of Mormon has come forth by the gift and
power of God....

49
“Another [contribution of the Prophet Joseph Smith]
is the restored priesthood. ...

“Another great and singular revelation given to
the Prophet was the plan for the eternal life of the
family... .

“The innocence of little children is another revelation
which God has given through the instrumentality of
the Prophet Joseph. ...

“.. The great doctrine of salvation for the dead is
unique to this Church. ...

50

“The eternal nature of man has been revealed. ...

“... There is one more that I must mention. This is the
principle of modern revelation... .

“.., During the brief 38 and one-half years of his
life, there came through [the Prophet Joseph Smith]
an incomparable outpouring of knowledge, gifts,
and doctrine” (“The Great Things Which God Has
Revealed,” Ensign, May 2005, 80-83).

After the Prophet Joseph Smith’s martyrdom,

2 Nephi 4—5

Introduction

In 2 Nephi 4 you will read how Lehi called his posterity
together to give them his final counsel and blessing
before he died. After Lehi’s death, Laman and Lemuel
became angry with Nephi for preaching to them “the
admonitions of the Lord” (see 2 Nephi 4:13-14).
Troubled by his brothers’ attitudes and actions and

by his own weaknesses and sins, Nephi recorded his
feelings in expressive and poetic language (see 2 Nephi
4:15-35). As recorded in 2 Nephi 5, the Lord warned
Nephi and those who supported him to flee from
Laman, Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael. Following
this separation, the Nephites lived in righteousness
and happiness, while those who stayed with Laman
and Lemuel cut themselves off spiritually from the
Lord. Nephi’s devotion to the Lord strengthened
him to overcome sin and discouragement. Nephi
then recorded how he and his people “lived after
the manner of happiness” (2 Nephi 5:27).

2 Nephi 4:3-11
Lehi counsels and blesses his family

Think of a time when you received counsel or advice
from your mother, father, or leaders. Did you follow
the advice? Why or why didn’t you follow the advice?
Do you have any regrets? In 2 Nephi 4:1-11, Nephi
recorded Lehi’s final counsel and blessing to his family.
Read 2 Nephi 4:4—5, and identify the counsel Lehi gave
his children that could also apply to you. Have your
parents, family members, or leaders ever given you
similar counsel?

{

1. Make a list in your scripture study journal of some of

the blessings that have come into your life from listening
to the counsel of those who care about you. What blessings have
come from being obedient to the commandments of the Lord?

2 Nephi 4:12-35

Nephi expresses his trust in the Lord and acknowledges
his weaknesses

In 2 Nephi 4:12-35, Nephi wrote “the things of [his]
soul” (2 Nephi 4:15). Read 2 Nephi 4:15-16, and look
for what Nephi delighted in.

Think about the wholesome things that bring you
great joy. Complete the following phrase with several
answers: My soul delighteth in

2. Write in your scripture study journal what you think it
means to delight in the things of the Lord.

made Nephi sorrowful.
As you read, keep the

following definitions in
mind: Wretched means
miserable or worthless. Flesh refers to weakness in our
mortal state. Beset means to surround or press in on

all sides, to trouble, or to harass. Though Nephi felt
sorrow for his sins, this should not be misunderstood
to mean that he was guilty of any major transgressions.

Consider a time in your life when you could relate to
how Nephi felt (such as when you have lost a loved
one, others have been angry with you for following the
Lord, you have faced hardship or disappointment, or
you have felt sorrow because of your sins, weaknesses,
and temptations). Read 2 Nephi 4:19, and identify

the phrase that expresses Nephi’s hope despite his
sorrows. What do you think Nephi meant when he
said, “I know in whom I have trusted”? How can you
put greater trust in God?

51
As you continue your study, look for evidence of the
gospel principle that God supports those who put
their trust in Him.

4. Write in your scripture study journal what you have
learned from studying 2 Nephi 4:17-35 and ways you
would like to increase your trust in the Lord.

2 Nephi 5:1-8
The Lord separates the Nephites from the Lamanites

As you study 2 Nephi 5, think of difficult problems
and decisions you may be experiencing or have

52

experienced. In this chapter Nephi explained that his
brothers “did seek to take away my life” (2 Nephi 5:2).
Notice in 2 Nephi 5:1 what Nephi did to find a solution
to the problem. Then mark in your scriptures what the
Lord did to help Nephi in 2 Nephi 5:5.

Asa result of this warning, Nephi and “all . . . those
who believed in the warnings and the revelations

of God” (2 Nephi 5:6) left the land of their first
inheritance. They journeyed “for the space of many
days” (2 Nephi 5:7) and settled in a place they called
Nephi. This experience illustrates that safety comes
from obeying the revelations of God.

Read the following testimony from Elder Paul V.
Johnson of the Seventy: “It is not surprising that in the
face of tremendous evil and temptation the Lord does
not leave us to find our way on our own. In fact, there
is more than enough guidance available to each of us
if we will listen. You have received the gift of the Holy
Ghost to direct and inspire you. You have the scriptures,
parents, Church leaders and teachers. You also have the
words of the prophets, seers, and revelators who live

in our day. There is so much guidance and direction
available that you won’t make major mistakes in your
life unless you consciously ignore the guidance you
receive” (“The Blessings of General Conference,”
Ensign, Nov. 2005, 51).

5. In your scripture study journal, write a warning you

have received from the Lord, His prophets, or other Church
leaders. What are you doing to heed that warning? How has
heeding that warning helped you in your life, and how will it help
you in the future?

2 Nephi 5:9-18, 26-27
The Nephites live after the manner of happiness

After recounting the circumstances that led to the
division of Lehi’s family, Nephi described what life was
like among “the people of Nephi” (2 Nephi 5:9). Read
2 Nephi 5:27, and mark the phrase that indicates how
the Nephites lived. What do you think it means to live
“after the manner of happiness”?

6. Carefully read 2 Nephi 5:10-18, 26, and mark in your

scriptures what the Nephites had or did that contributed
to their happiness. Select one of these things, and write in your
scripture study journal how that action or attitude has
contributed to your happiness. For example, if you chose the fact
that the Nephites built a temple (see 2 Nephi 5:16), you could
write how the temple has brought greater happiness to you or
your family.

The actions and attitudes you have identified are part
of living the gospel of Jesus Christ. You may want
to write the following principle in your scriptures
next to 2 Nephi 5:27: As the gospel of Jesus Christ
becomes our way of life, we increase in happiness.
This was true for the Nephites even during a time

of great difficulty. Examine your life and determine
something you will do to live more fully after the way
of happiness. Write it down in your personal journal
or in your scriptures. The principles you have studied
today lead to happiness.

2 Nephi 6-8

Introduction

Nephi’s record of the first part of a sermon taught by

his younger brother Jacob is found in 2 Nephi 6-8. (The
second part of Jacob’s sermon is found in 2 Nephi 9-10.)
Jacob prophesied that since the time Lehi left Jerusalem,
the Jews had been taken captive and scattered because
of their wickedness. However, the Lord would mercifully
gather the Jews back to Jerusalem. Jacob also prophesied
that the Jews would be scattered a second time after they
rejected the Savior during His mortal ministry; again the
Lord would show mercy and gather them in the last days
as they come to a knowledge of the Savior. Additionally,
Jacob quoted Isaiah’s prophecies showing the Savior’s
loyalty to His covenant people, His mercy, and the
greatness of His promises to the faithful.

2 Nephi 6
Jacob prophesies of the scattering and gathering of Israel

How would you act if people you loved treated you
unkindly? What if they showed by their actions or
attitudes that your relationship was no longer important
to them? Ponder if you have ever acted this way toward
the Lord. In 2 Nephi 6-8, Jacob taught how the Lord
responds to those who, by their attitudes and actions,
have turned away from Him.

Read 2 Nephi 6:3-5; 9:1, 3, and look for reasons why

Jacob gave this sermon.

As you study today, look
for how Jacob’s teachings
can help you “learn

and glorify the name

of your God” (2 Nephi
6:4), better understand
the covenants you have
made with the Lord (see
2 Nephi 9:1), and give
you reason to “rejoice,
and lift up your heads
forever” (2 Nephi 9:3).

1. Answer the
following questions in
your scripture study journal:

a. Jacob begins his sermon
by prophesying what
happened to the Jews after
Lehi left Jerusalem because
they had rejected the Lord.
How did he describe it in

2 Nephi 6:8?

b. Lehi, Jeremiah, and other
prophets prophesied about

Look for the
Author's Intent

It is useful to pay close
attention to verses or phrases
that indicate why a speaker
or writer in the scriptures
taught what he did. For
example, phrases like “I
speak unto you . . . that ye
may /earn and glorify the
name of your God” (2 Nephi
6:4: italics added) and “that
ye might know concerning
the covenants of the Lord
that he has covenanted

with all the house of Israel”
(2 Nephi 9:1; italics added)
help us understand Jacob's
intent. Such phrases can help
you better understand and
focus on the main ideas and
principles in the scriptures.

this destruction. When the Babylonians conquered the Jews in
about 587 B.C., many were killed and others were taken captive
into Babylon. The Jews eventually softened their hearts toward
the Lord. According to the first sentence of 2 Nephi 6:9, what
did Jacob prophesy would happen to them?

c. Jacob prophesied that the Savior would live His mortal life
among the Jews after they returned from captivity. According
to 2 Nephi 6:9-10, how would the Jews act and feel toward

the Savior?

d. According to 2 Nephi 6:10-11, what would happen to the

Jews who rejected the Savior?

Read 2 Nephi 6:11, 14, and look for phrases that
describe how the Lord feels about the house of Israel
even though they rejected Him. You may want to circle
the phrases “merciful unto them” and “recover them”

in your scriptures.

2. In your scripture study journal, write your answers to

the following questions:

a. What does it mean to “recover” someone or something?

b. How does the Lord's willingness to recover Israel a second

time show His mercy?

53

In these same verses Jacob taught what the Jews must
do in order to receive these blessings from the Lord.
Read 2 Nephi 6:11, 14 again, and find the phrase
“when they shall” in each verse. Highlight the words
that complete the phrase. According to these verses,
how will Israel qualify for the Lord’s mercy? These
verses teach the principle: The Lord is merciful to
those who return to Him.

3. Ponder ways you have witnessed the Lord’s mercy

and willingness to forgive those who return to Him. In
your scripture study journal write: / know the Lord is merciful
because... Then complete the statement with your own
thoughts and feelings. You may want to repeat this exercise as
you think of different ways the Lord has demonstrated that He
is merciful.

In 2 Nephi 6 there is a great promise of hope for
Israel—which includes all of us. Read 2 Nephi 6:17-18,
and complete the following promises made by the
Savior:

“The Mighty God shall ”
(2 Nephi 6:17).

“All flesh shall know that ”
(2 Nephi 6:18).

2 Nephi 7-8
Jacob quotes Isaiah's prophecies about the Savior's loyalty
to the covenant people and His ability to redeem us

As recorded in 2 Nephi 7-8, Jacob quoted Isaiah’s
prophecies concerning the Lord’s desire and ability to

redeem Israel from the sufferings caused by their sins.

Read 2 Nephi 7:1—2, and identify questions the Lord
asked Israel that indicate He still loved them and
wanted to redeem them.

It may be helpful to understand that the Lord used
symbolic language relating to divorce and slavery, and
the social customs familiar to people of that day, to
teach them in an impactful and memorable way. The
phrases “put thee away,” “the bill of your mother’s
divorcement,” and “sold you” refer to the idea of
breaking or severing a covenant. The questions could
be rephrased as follows: “Have I turned away from
you? Have I put aside the covenant we have made?”
The answer to these questions is, “No.” The Lord will
never turn away from us or forget the covenants He
has made. His questions are a way of emphasizing that
He will never break His covenant with Israel.

54

At the end of 2 Nephi 7:1, underline the Lord’s
explanation of why Israel was separated from God
and suffering in captivity.

4. Answer one of the following questions in your
scripture study journal:

a. Why is it important to understand that our thoughts,
decisions, and actions can separate us from God?

b. Why is it important for you to know that the Lord never forgets
or forsakes us, even though we may forget and forsake Him?

In 2 Nephi 7:2 the Lord asked Israel a vital question
that applies to each of us. Find and highlight the
question.

What do you think the Lord meant when He asked,
“Ts my hand shortened at all that it cannot redeem?”
To help you visualize this, imagine you are stretching
out your hand, trying to reach someone in need. If you
were to lengthen your reach, what would you be trying
to do for the person in need? If instead you shortened
or pulled back your hand, what would it say about your
desire to help the person? With this imagery in mind,
another way to phrase the Lord’s question to Israel is:
“Am [holding back and not reaching out to redeem
you?”

The phrase “have I no power to deliver?” invited Israel
to ponder on their faith that the Lord had the power to
deliver them from the suffering caused by their sins.

In the remainder of 2 Nephi 7-8, Isaiah gave several
examples of the Savior’s desire and power to redeem
His covenant people.

Read 2 Nephi 7:5-7, and look for phrases in this
prophecy that tell what the Messiah would do

and experience as part of His atoning sacrifice to
redeem us. In 2 Nephi 7:6, footnote a, there are cross
references that explain and show the fulfillment of this
prophecy. You might want to mark Matthew 27:26 in
the footnote; then read Matthew 27:26-31, looking for
ways Isaiah’s prophecy was fulfilled.

5. Answer the following question in your scripture study
journal: What does 2 Nephi 7:2, 5-7 show us about the
Savior's desire and willingness to redeem us?

To help you discover further evidence of the Lord’s
mercy and power in the remainder of Isaiah’s prophecy,
imagine you were asked to give a talk in church on the
principle: The Savior desires to redeem His covenant
people and has all power to do so. To prepare for
your talk, read 2 Nephi 8:3, 11-13, 16, 22, and choose
phrases that you feel offer assurance of the Lord’s
desire and power to redeem us.

6. Make an outline of your talk in your scripture study
journal by:

a. Listing two or three phrases that stood out to you and
explaining how each phrase is an example of the Savior's desire
to redeem us or of His power to do so.

b. Choosing one of those phrases and describing how you have

either experienced, or would like to experience, that blessing in
your life.

As you finish this lesson, remember that Jacob taught
the truths you have studied today “that ye may learn
and glorify the name of your God” (2 Nephi 6:4), “that
ye might know concerning the covenants of the Lord”
(2 Nephi 9:1), and “that ye may rejoice, and lift up your
heads forever” (2 Nephi 9:3). Look for an opportunity
today to share your appreciation for the Lord and His
love for you with someone.

2 Nephi 9

Introduction

Your study of Jacob’s sermon, which began in 2 Nephi
6-8, continues in 2 Nephi 9. In 2 Nephi 6-8 you studied
Jacob’s teachings about the Savior’s mercy and His
power to deliver the house of Israel from their lost

and scattered state. In chapter 9 you will study Jacob’s
testimony of the power of the Savior’s Atonement to
deliver us from the effects of the Fall, including both
physical and spiritual death as well as the consequences
of our sins. President Joseph Fielding Smith taught that
2 Nephi 9 is “one of the most enlightening discourses
ever delivered in regard to the atonement... . It should
be carefully read by every person seeking salvation”
(Answers to Gospel Questions, comp. Joseph Fielding
Smith Jr., 5 vols. [1957-66], 4:57).

2 Nephi 9:1-9
Jacob teaches that the Fall brought physical and spiritual
death upon all mankind

What comes to mind when you think of the word
monster?

The word monster usually refers to something that
is frightening and capable of inflicting great harm.
Although many people think only of imaginary
creatures when they think of a monster, consider if
there is anything that is actually capable of bringing
lasting harm to you and is, therefore, genuinely
frightening. Jacob used the image of a monster to
symbolize a frightening condition we all face in
mortality. Read 2 Nephi 9:10, and identify the two
elements of the monster that Jacob described. Then
fill in the blanks in the chart below.

Awful Monster

"d of the "d

It is important to understand that when Jacob taught
about the “death of the spirit” he did not mean that
our spirits would literally die, but rather that we are
spiritually separated or cut off from the presence of
God (see 2 Nephi 9:6). This separation is often referred
to as spiritual death in the scriptures. You may wish to
write the phrase cut off from the presence of God in the
margin of your scriptures next to “death of the spirit”
in 2 Nephi 9:10.

Read 2 Nephi 9:6, and notice that Jacob began by
talking about the death of the body and ended by
discussing being cut off from the presence of God.
Search this verse carefully. What event brought both
physical death and spiritual death upon mankind?

Read 2 Nephi 9:79, and identify what Jacob taught
would happen to our bodies and our spirits if there
were no Atonement and physical and spiritual death
remained forever. Before you read, it will help you to
know the meaning of the following terms Jacob uses
in verse 7: The phrase “the first judgment which came
upon man” (2 Nephi 9:7) refers to the consequences
of the Fall of Adam and Eve. The term corruption
refers to the mortal body because it is imperfect and
will eventually die. The term incorruption refers to the
resurrected body, which will live forever.

55
1. In your scripture study journal, list a few phrases you
“< identified in 2 Nephi 9:7—9 that describe what would
happen to our bodies and spirits if there were no Atonement.

Read the following statement by Elder D. Todd
Christofferson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles to
clarify what our fate would be without the Atonement
of Jesus Christ: “If our separation from God and our
physical death were permanent, moral agency would
mean nothing. Yes, we would be free to make choices,
but what would be the point? The end result would
always be the same no matter what our actions: death
with no hope of resurrection and no hope of heaven.

As good or as bad as we might choose to be, we would
all end up ‘angels to a devil’” (“Moral Agency,” Ensign,
June 2009, 50).

ww 2. Write a sentence in your scripture study journal
~~ explaining in your own words what you think Elder
Christofferson was saying about our fallen condition. Add a
short explanation of why you think Jacob would compare
physical death and being separated from God to an “awful
monster.”

2 Nephi 9:10-27
Jacob teaches how the Savior's suffering delivers us from
the effects of the fall and the consequences of sin

God did not leave us to suffer the full effects of “that
awful monster, death and hell.” Read 2 Nephi 9:10,
and mark what God has prepared for us.

Read the following analogy from President Joseph
Fielding Smith that illustrates our need for a Savior:

“A man walking along the road happens to fall into a
pit so deep and dark that he cannot climb to the surface
and regain his freedom. How can he save himself from
his predicament? Not by any exertions on his part,

for there is no means of escape in the pit. He calls for
help and some kindly disposed soul, hearing his cries
for relief, hastens to his assistance and by lowering a
ladder, gives to him the means by which he may climb
again to the surface of the earth.

“This was precisely the condition that Adam placed
himself and his posterity in, when he partook of the
forbidden fruit. All being together in the pit, none
could gain the surface and relieve the others. The pit
was banishment from the presence of the Lord and
temporal death, the dissolution of the body. And all
being subject to death, none could provide the means
of escape.

“Therefore, in his infinite mercy, the Father heard the
cries of his children and sent his Only Begotten Son,
who was not subject to death nor to sin, to provide
the means of escape. This he did through his infinite
atonement and the everlasting gospel” (Doctrines of
Salvation, ed. Bruce R. McConkie, 3 vols. [1954-56],
1:126-27).

Most of Jacob’s message in chapter 9 focuses on the
way the Lord prepared for us to escape the grasp of
physical and spiritual death, and it assures us that we
can be delivered.

3. Search 2 Nephi 9:5, 19-21, and answer the following
questions in your scripture study journal:

a. According to 2 Nephi 9:5, 21, what did the Savior go through
so that we can be delivered from death and hell?

b. For whom did the Savior suffer, according to 2 Nephi 9:21?

Think about how many people “belong to the family
of Adam” (2 Nephi 9:21). This includes all those who
have lived, are now living, and will yet live on the
earth—including you. You may want to write your
name next to 2 Nephi 9:21 to remember the Savior’s
sacrifice was made for you.

Because of the Fall, we are cut off from God’s presence,
but because of Christ’s suffering, all will again stand

From Jacob’s teachings we learn the doctrine: The
Atonement of Jesus Christ delivers all mankind
from physical and spiritual death brought by
the Fall.

In addition to this message of hope, Jacob taught that
the Savior’s suffering can also deliver us from the
spiritual death caused by our own sins. Read 2 Nephi
9:27, and identify how Jacob described the state of
those who transgress or sin. Read 2 Nephi 9:15-16, and
mark the spiritual anguish or torment that our sins will
bring upon us if we don’t repent.

57
In addition to this torment, notice the phrase “they shall
go away” in 2 Nephi 9:16. Because of the Atonement,
all mankind will return to the presence of God to be
judged. However, if we have not repented of our sins,
we will again be separated from God’s presence. While
deliverance from the Fall is a gift to all mankind, our
deliverance from the consequences of our personal sins
depends on our desires and actions. Read 2 Nephi 9:21,
23-24. Because of the Atonement, what can we do to be
saved from the eternal consequences of our sins?

After reading Jacob’s words, complete the following
principle: Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ,
we can overcome the consequences of our sins if we

Take a moment and reflect on what you can do to
more fully feel the cleansing power of the Savior’s
Atonement. Are there things the Lord would have you
repent of? Ponder how you can repent of these things.
How can you better hearken to His voice?

atoning sacrifice for you.

2 Nephi 9-10

Introduction

In the previous lesson you studied Jacob’s testimony
of what Jesus Christ would do for us through His
Atonement. In this lesson you will complete your study
of 2 Nephi 9 and the first day of Jacob’s sermon and
learn what we must do to receive the blessings of the
Atonement. Jacob warned against making decisions
that lead to a separation from God, and he invited

all to come to Christ and be saved. You will also read
2 Nephi 10 and study what Jacob told the people the

next day. Jacob again taught that although Israel would

be scattered because of sin, the Lord would remember

58

His covenants with them, and He would gather them
when they repented and returned to Him. Jacob said
that there was “none other nation on earth that would

crucify their God” (2 Nephi 10:3). He foretold that
America would be a land of liberty, fortified against all
nations, and have no kings upon it. Jacob testified that
one must submit to God’s will and remember that only
through God’s grace would they be saved.

2 Nephi 9:28-54
Jacob warns of actions and attitudes that separate us from
God and invites all to come unto Christ

Because of the Fall and because of our personal sins,
each of us needs the Savior. Jacob testified that through
the Atonement we are freed from the effects of the
Fall and can overcome our sins and receive eternal life.
Jacob used the image of a gate and path to illustrate
this. Read 2 Nephi 9:41, and look for how Jacob
described the path we must walk to attain eternal life.
Ponder the following questions: What do you think it
means to “come unto the Lord”? (Consider if you are
on the path that will bring you closer to the Savior.)
What does it mean to you that “the way [to the Savior]
is narrow, but it lieth in a straight course”?

Jacob also described the Savior as “the keeper of the
gate.” This is symbolic of the Savior’s role as our judge.
It is He who extends the blessings of His Atonement
to us based on our attitudes and actions. Jacob also
taught us more specifically how our attitudes and
actions affect our ability to come to the Savior.

1. To help you identify attitudes, thoughts, and actions
that can lead us to the Savior, do the following in your
scripture study journal:
a. Draw a line down the center of a full page in your scripture
study journal, and write Distancing Ourselves from Christ on one
side and Coming unto Christ on the other side.

b. Read 2 Nephi 9:27—39, and identify any actions or attitudes
that Jacob warned can distance us from the Savior. Make a list
of what you find that belongs in the ”Distancing Ourselves from
Christ” column in your scripture study journal. You may also
want to mark what you find in your scriptures. (Note that

2 Nephi 9:28-29 is a scripture mastery passage. You may want
to mark it in a distinctive way so you can locate it in the future.)

c. Choose one of the actions or attitudes that you identified,
and answer the following question on a separate page in your
scripture study journal: How can this action or attitude keep us
from coming to Christ and receiving the full blessings of His
Atonement?

d. In addition to warning about actions and attitudes that
distance us from the Lord, Jacob taught about actions and
attitudes that will help us come to Jesus Christ. Read 2 Nephi
9:23, 42, 45-46, 49-52, and find what Jacob taught would
bring us to the Lord. List what you find in the “Coming unto
Christ” column of your chart.

Studying 2 Nephi 9:28—54, you learned the principle:
By choosing to come to the Lord and live according
to His will, we can receive the full blessings of the
Atonement.

2. To help you apply what you have learned, write your
answers to the questions in two or more of the
assignments below in your scripture study journal:

a. In 2 Nephi 9:23 you read that the Lord commanded us to
repent and be baptized. Though you may already be baptized,
how does renewing baptismal covenants through the sacrament
help you come to the Lord and receive the blessings of His
Atonement?

b. What do you think it means to have ” perfect faith in the
Holy One of Israel” (2 Nephi 9:23)? What are some ways you
currently show faith in the Lord?

c. What does it mean to “turn away from your sins” (2 Nephi
9:45)? What can help you turn away from your sins?

d. What are some examples of spending money “for that which
is of no worth” or working “for that which cannot satisfy”

(2 Nephi 9:51)? How does avoiding evil or trivial pursuits help
you come to the Lord? How can you better balance how you
spend your time in various school, study, Church, recreational,
and social activities?

e. What are some ways you can “feast upon that which
perisheth not” (2 Nephi 9:51)?

f. Jacob urged the people to “give thanks” and to “let your
hearts rejoice” (2 Nephi 9:52). Why do you think it is important
to follow this counsel as you strive to come to the Savior?

3. Write in your scripture study journal how one or more
of the actions and attitudes you have studied have
brought you closer to the Savior.

CJ Scripture Mastery—2 Nephi 9:28-29

What are you doing to make the most of your current
educational opportunities? What are your future plans
for your education?

Read the following statement from President Gordon B.
Hinckley, and underline the blessings that can come
from learning: “You face great challenges that lie ahead.
You are moving into a world of fierce competition. You
must get all of the education you can. The Lord has
instructed us concerning the importance of education.
It will qualify you for greater opportunities. It will equip
you to do something worthwhile in the great world of
opportunity that lies ahead. If you can go to college

59
and that is your wish, then do it. If you have no desire
to attend college, then go to a vocational or business
school to sharpen your skills and increase your
capacity” (“Converts and Young Men,” Ensign, May
1997, 49-50).

Read 2 Nephi 9:28, and mark what Jacob said were
pitfalls of learning with the wrong attitude.

4. Answer the following question in your scripture study
journal:

a. What do you think the statement “when they are learned
they think they are wise” means?

b. What are the dangers of thinking we are wiser than a parent,

our bishop or branch president, the prophet, or our Heavenly
Father?

Read 2 Nephi 9:29, and identify what you need to
remember as you seek education.

5. In your scripture study journal, answer the following
question: How does diligent scripture study help you live
according to the principle in 2 Nephi 9:29?

2 Nephi 10
Jacob encourages the people to rejoice and come to the Lord

During the second day of his teaching, Jacob again
testified of the Lord’s power of deliverance from the
consequences of sin. Jacob also taught his people
how they should respond to the merciful gift of the
Atonement. Read 2 Nephi 10:20, 23-25, and mark
phrases that indicate what Jacob taught we should
do in response to the Savior’s sacrifice for us.

6. Answer one or more of the following questions in
your scripture study journal:

a. Considering what you have studied about the Savior, why do
you want to always “remember him” (2 Nephi 10:20)?

b. Why do you feel that laying aside or repenting of something
you are doing wrong would show your gratitude and love for the
Savior?

c. What have you learned about the Savior that helps you feel
hope rather than “hang down” your head in discouragement?

An important phrase in this chapter is “reconcile
yourselves to the will of God” 2 Nephi 10:24). It
means that we should reestablish a close relationship
with the Lord in which we are obedient and in
harmony with His will. Review any scriptures you
have marked in 2 Nephi 9-10. Seek the guidance of
the Holy Spirit as you determine something you can
do to reconcile yourself to the will of God.

with my teacher:

2 Nephi 11-16

Introduction

The prophet Isaiah lived approximately 100 years before
the time of Nephi. (Isaiah started prophesying sometime
previous to 740 B.C. and continued prophesying for over
40 years, until 701 B.C.; see Bible Dictionary, “Isaiah.”)
In many ways, Nephi may have had the same feelings
of admiration and love for Isaiah that we have today

for the Prophet Joseph Smith. We know from Nephi’s
writings that he “delighted” in Isaiah’s words (see

2 Nephi 11:2). As recorded in 2 Nephi 12-16, Nephi
quoted from Isaiah’s writings, which were found on the
brass plates. These writings described ancient Israel’s
pride and wickedness and the judgments that awaited
them. Isaiah also recounted his vision of the Lord, in

which he was cleansed of his sins.

2 Nephi 11:1-8
Nephi delights in Isaiah’s
testimony of Jesus Christ

Think about a time when
you were impressed with
someone's testimony of
the Savior. Read 2 Nephi
11:2-3, and identify what
experience Nephi, Jacob,
and Isaiah each had with
Jesus Christ.

The Lord calls prophets
to bear witness of

Him. By studying the
testimonies of witnesses
of Jesus Christ, we can
strengthen our faith in
Jesus Christ and rejoice
in Him.

Studying Isaiah

| \4
Although you may find
the Isaiah chapters in the
Book of Mormon difficult
to understand, President
Boyd K. Packer, President of
the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles, gave this encour-
aging counsel: “Do not stop
reading! Move forward
through those difficult-to-
understand chapters of Old
Testament prophecy, even
if you understand very little
of it. Move on, if all you do
is skim and merely glean an
impression here and there”
(“The Things of My Soul,”
Ensign, May 1986, 61).

1. In your scripture study journal, write your thoughts
about why you think it is important to have a witness of
Jesus Christ from multiple prophets.

Find the four times Nephi said “my soul delighteth”
in 2 Nephi 11:4—6. You might want to mark these in
your scriptures.

To “delight” in something suggests that one takes
great pleasure in it and that the thing brings great joy.

2. Write in your scripture study journal three or more
“my soul delighteth” statements that represent elements
of the gospel you delight in. Explain why each of these brings
you joy.
Read 2 Nephi 11:8, and write what Nephi hoped
would result from your study of the writings of Isaiah.

2 Nephi 12:1-5
Isaiah prophesies that a temple will be established in the
last days

Imagine a large mountain. Can you think of any
comparisons that can be drawn between a mountain
and a temple?

Read 2 Nephi 12:2-3, 5, looking for what God promised
to establish in the last days. The term “mountain of the
Lord’s house” means a temple of the Lord. According
to these verses, what blessings will come from the
Lord’s house in the last days?

You may want to write in your scriptures something
like this: God has established temples to teach us
of His ways and to help us walk in His paths (see

2 Nephi 12:3).

3. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. How do temples help us walk in the Lord’s paths?
b. How can you prepare yourself to enter the temple?

2 Nephi 12-15

This lesson will not provide detailed helps for
understanding 2 Nephi 12-15. However, as you read
and ponder these chapters in your personal reading
of the Book of Mormon, look for the consequences
of pride and sin. The following commentary, or
explanation, will also help you in your reading:

2 Nephi 12:6—-18. Take special notice of all the references
to the worshipping of idols, as well as words and images
that indicate pride—for instance, lofty, haughtiness, proud,
lifted up, and high. This will help you understand why
such severe judgments awaited these people.

2 Nephi 12:9-11. The “mean man” (verse 9) refers
to the ordinary or common man. Both the “mean
man” and the “great man,” if they are proud, will be
humbled at the Second Coming of Jesus Christ (see
verse 11).

2 Nephi 12:12-13. “The day of the Lord” is a phrase
that refers to a time of judgment. The Second Coming
of Christ will be a “day of the Lord” when the wicked
will be destroyed.

61
2 Nephi 13-14. In 2 Nephi 13 is the continuation of
Isaiah’s discussion of what will happen if the Israelites
persist in their wickedness. Isaiah called the Israelite
women the “daughters of Zion” (verse 16), suggesting
that they are children of the covenant. Isaiah likened
them to a prideful woman who is cursed by the Lord,
and all her jewelry and other physical adornments

are taken away (see 2 Nephi 13:16-26). In contrast,

2 Nephi 14 includes Isaiah’s description of what will
happen if the daughters of Zion humble themselves,
repent, and turn to the Lord. If you have access to an
LDS edition of the Bible, use the footnotes for Isaiah 3
to help you understand 2 Nephi 13:16—26.

2 Nephi 15:8—22. The word
wo refers to a condition

of deep sadness. Isaiah
used it six times in these
verses as he identified

the sins of the Israelites.
Isaiah knew that if the
Israelites did not repent,
the consequences of their
sins would bring deep
sadness—especially at the
time of judgment. If Isaiah
were a prophet on earth
today, would he find the
same kinds of sins that he
saw among the Israelites?

4. Read 2 Nephi 15:20. Write in your scripture study
journal some ways in which people today call good
things evil, or evil things good.

2 Nephi 16:1-8
Isaiah is called to serve as a prophet

Isaiah’s writings are rich in symbolism. Symbols are
one way the Lord teaches us about gospel principles.
As recorded in 2 Nephi 16, Isaiah described his
experience of seeing the Lord. As you read 2 Nephi 16,
keep in mind the following symbols and their possible
meanings:

Seraphim: Angels who reside in the presence of God.
The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that “an angel of
God never has wings” (History of the Church, 3:392).
The angels’ wings symbolized their power to move
and to act.

Smoke: May indicate the presence of the Lord (see
Revelation 15:8).

Unclean lips: Unworthiness.

Live coal (fire): Purifying agent, like the cleansing
power of the Holy Ghost.

62

Altar: Literally, an altar was the place where sacrifices
were made. It may refer here to the sacrifice made by
Jesus Christ on our behalf—the Atonement.

5. Read 2 Nephi 16:1-7, and record in your scripture
study journal your answers to the following questions:

a. What did one of the seraphim say about the Lord of Hosts?

b. What do you think Isaiah meant when he said, “Wo is unto
me! for | am undone; because | am a man of unclean lips”?
What made him suddenly feel this way? (3 Nephi 27:19 may
offer a suggestion.)

c. What happened to change Isaiah's feelings of unworthiness?

d. How would this experience prepare Isaiah to go out among
the people and teach repentance?

One of the great truths taught in the calling of Isaiah is
that we can be cleansed of our unworthiness through
the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Ponder about a time
when you felt the cleansing power of the Atonement in
yout life.

6. Write the following at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture study journal:

with my teacher:

2 Nephi 17-20

Introduction

In 2 Nephi 17-20, Nephi recorded that Isaiah tried
to persuade the king of Judah and his people to trust
in the Lord rather than in worldly alliances. Using
types and shadows—symbols or representations that
teach and testify of great truths—Isaiah prophesied
concerning events of his own day, the birth of Jesus
Christ, and the destruction of the wicked at the
Second Coming of the Lord.

2 Nephi 17-18
The kingdom of Judah is blessed when they put their trust
in Jesus Christ

To help prepare you for today’s lesson, think of a time
when you were faced with a fearful situation. Do you
recall your first reaction? As you study 2 Nephi 17-18,
try to identify Isaiah’s counsel to those who find
themselves in a difficult or fearful situation.
For your study of 2 Nephi 17-18, you will need to
know about the three small nations of Syria, Israel,
and Judah, as well as the much larger Assyrian Empire,
which sought to conquer these smaller nations. Review
the following map and the accompanying chart.

NORTHERN KINGDOM

Jerusalem @

SOUTHERN
KINGDOM OF
JUDAH

Nation Syria Israel Judah
(Ephraim)

King Rezin Pekah Ahaz

Capital Damascus Samaria Jerusalem

Read 2 Nephi 17:12, and refer to the map. “Syria

is confederate with Ephraim” means that these two
countries formed an alliance or agreement. Try to
determine who was attacking whom. Be aware that
the phrase “house of David” in verse 2 refers to Ahaz
and the people of Judah.

The kingdoms of Israel and Syria wanted to conquer
the kingdom of Judah and force Judah to enter into
an alliance with them against the powerful Assyrian
Empire. Assyria was threatening to conquer an
entire region of the world at that time. Israel and
Syria believed that by conquering Judah, they could
have more people and more resources to fight the
approaching Assyrians (see 2 Nephi 17:5—-6). King
Ahaz contemplated making this alliance with Israel
and Syria.

Consider what you would do if you were King

Ahaz. On one side, Assyria is threatening to attack
your people. On the other side, Syria and Israel are
threatening to attack if you do not join an alliance
with them to fight against Assyria. Isaiah lived in the
kingdom of Judah, and the Lord sent him to Ahaz with
a message. How do you think you would feel about a
message from the prophet if you were King Ahaz?

1. Read 2 Nephi 17:3-8, and underline the Lord’s

message to Ahaz and his people, as given through the
prophet Isaiah. (The term “smoking firebrands” in verse 4 refers
to a torch whose flame has burned out, symbolic of these two
kingdoms being broken and conquered.) Imagine you heard
Isaiah say this to Ahaz. Later, a friend asks you what Isaiah said.
Write two or three sentences in your scripture study journal
describing how you would answer your friend.

Isaiah tried to help the king and his people rely on the
Lord for help, rather than trusting in unstable political
alliances.

2. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:
a. Why is it important for us to turn to the Lord when we need
help rather than relying only on other people to help us?
b. What are some ways in which young people may be tempted
to put their relationships with other people before their
relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ?

The Lord said he would give Ahaz and the kingdom
of Judah a sign that He would protect them and that
they would not need to rely on worldly alliances.
Read 2 Nephi 17:14 to determine the sign. Circle the
word Immanuel in this verse. Next to this verse write
“Matthew 1:22-23.” Read Matthew 1:22-23 to discover
the meaning of the title Immanuel.

63
How would a sign that meant “God with us” help
Ahaz at this time? How could such a prophecy by
Isaiah also have reference to the birth of Jesus Christ
centuries later?

For further understanding of the sign

of a child being born, contemplate the
following explanation by Elder Jeffrey R.
Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles: “There are plural or parallel
elements to this prophecy, as with so
much of Isaiah’s writing. The most immediate meaning
was probably focused on Isaiah’s wife, a pure and good
woman who brought forth a son about this time [see
2 Nephi 18:3], the child becoming a type and a shadow
of the greater, later fulfillment of the prophecy that
would be realized in the birth of Jesus Christ” (Christ
and the New Covenant |1997], 79).

Isaiah prophesied that before the child was grown,
Assyria would conquer the armies of both Israel
(Ephraim) and Syria (see 2 Nephi 17:15—-25).The sign
meaning “God with us” was intended to reassure
King Ahaz that God will be with us when we trust
in Him, even during times of difficulty and fear.
Consider writing this principle in your scriptures.

Read 2 Nephi 18:6—8, and underline the phrase
“waters of Shiloah.” The waters of Shiloah symbolized

64

for Isaiah the calming, steady, sustaining influence
and power of God that needed to be part of the
nation’s political life (see 2 Nephi 18:6). Isaiah used
the reference to the waters of Shiloah as a contrast
because the people of Israel and the people of Judah
rejected the Messiah—* the waters of Shiloah,” or the
calm, soft, steady, sustaining power of God. Therefore,
as Isaiah prophesied, the king of Assyria and the
horrible influence and torrential power of his invading
army—tepresented by “the waters of the river, strong
and many”— conquered Syria and Israel.

Isaiah, as a poet, used the two flowing but dramatically
different streams of water to explain what would happen
to Judah. The Assyrian army then came upon Judah—
represented by the word /and. But the army did not
conquer Jerusalem—trepresented by the statement “he
shall overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the
neck.”

Read 2 Nephi 18:9-12, and notice how many times the
Lord counseled Judah not to join with Syria and Israel.
As recorded in 2 Nephi 18:13, where did the Lord,
through Isaiah, counsel Judah to go for help instead?

By the time the Assyrians had overrun Judah and were
threatening Jerusalem, the kingdom of Judah had

a new king. His name was Hezekiah. He trusted in
the Lord and the prophet Isaiah. Eventually 185,000
Assyrian soldiers were slain in their camp by an angel
of the Lord (see 2 Kings 19:35; Isaiah 37:36).

3. Answer one or more of the following questions in
your scripture study journal:

a. What are the dangers of putting your trust in worldly things
and influences rather than in the Lord? (You might want to think
of situations that might tempt you to make decisions based on
fear.)

b. When have you turned to the Lord for strength when you
were initially tempted to turn to other sources? What did you
learn from the experience?

c. Under King Hezekiah, the people of Judah were spared from
destruction because they followed Isaiah's counsel from the
Lord. How can following modern prophets guard you against
spiritual harm?

2 Nephi 19:1-7
Isaiah speaks Messianically

Have you ever gone for a long time without seeing the
sun or feeling its warmth? If you have not, imagine that
you had a constant shadow on you, with no access to the
light and warmth of the sun (like being in a dark room
all the time). Isaiah used a similar image to illustrate the
spiritual condition of people who live without the light
of Jesus Christ.

There are two lands mentioned in 2 Nephi 19:1-2.
Read these verses, and mark the names of the two
lands.

Over the centuries prior to the time Isaiah wrote
these verses, multiple wars had been fought in an
attempt to control the area now known as the Holy
Land. Some referred to this area as “the land of the
shadow of death” because so many had lost their
lives there in battle. During New Testament times,
Nazareth, Capernaum, Nain, and Cana were located
in the regions formally known as the lands of Zebulun
and Naphtali. These are cities where Jesus Christ
spent much of His time, ministering to the people
more than 500 years later. It is known today as the
Galilee area.

Mark in 2 Nephi 19:2 what Isaiah said the people of
this region would eventually see.

Isaiah’s statement that those who “walked in
darkness” and dwelt in the “land of the shadow of
death” had “seen a great light” was a prophecy about
Jesus Christ’s mortal mission in this part of the world.
The people who lived in the Galilee area were walking
in spiritual darkness, but when Jesus Christ lived and
ministered among them, they saw “a great light.”

4. Read 2 Nephi 19:6-7, and contemplate which of

the Savior's titles in verse 6 might have been especially
meaningful to the people of Judah, given their circumstances. In
your scripture study journal, write how one or more of these titles
describes how you feel about the Savior.

2 Nephi 19-20
Isaiah describes the destruction of the wicked at the
Second Coming

Isaiah’s prophecy of the destruction of Assyria,
recorded in 2 Nephi 20, is also a prophecy of the
destruction of the wicked at the Second Coming. As
you read this chapter, remember that just as Hezekiah
trusted in Isaiah’s counsel from the Lord and was
blessed, if you place your confidence in the Lord, you
need not fear the judgments that will come upon the
inhabitants of the earth in the time leading up the
Second Coming.

What sentence is repeated in 2 Nephi 19:12, 17, 21
and 2 Nephi 20:4? You may wish to mark this in your
scriptures. Write the sentence in your study journal,
and underline the word anger and the word hand.
Under the word anger, write judgment, and under the
word hand, write mercy. Read the sentence aloud,
substituting the words judgment and mercy. (“For all
this his [judgment] is not turned away, but his [mercy]
is stretched out still.”)

5. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. How does the sentence in the study exercise above describe
how the Lord responds to nations, families, or individuals who
reject Him?

b. How can you apply the following truths in your life? Jesus
Christ is a God of judgment and mercy. His mercy is
extended to those who repent and keep His
commandments.

6. In your scripture study journal, write about a time
when you were obedient to a certain commandment and
felt God's mercy.

2 Nephi 21-24

Introduction

Many of Isaiah’s prophecies in the Book of Mormon
are about the last days. He prophesied about the
Restoration of the gospel, the Prophet Joseph Smith,
the Second Coming, and the destruction of the wicked.
He foresaw that the Lord would “set up an ensign

for the nations” to gather His people in the last days
(see 2 Nephi 21:11-12). Isaiah also testified that the
Lord would triumph over Satan and usher in the
Millennium, an era of peace and joy.

2 Nephi 21:1—4, 10-12
Isaiah foresees the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ
in the latter days

Pause for a moment, and imagine a light beginning
to appear before you. The light becomes brighter and
brighter. Suddenly a messenger sent from the presence

66

of God is standing in front of you. He tells you that
ancient prophecies are about to be fulfilled and that
you will help in their fulfillment. What would be your
initial reactions, thoughts, and questions?

On the night Moroni first appeared to Joseph Smith—
September 21, 1823—he quoted Isaiah 11, which is
also found in 2 Nephi 21. Moroni told Joseph Smith
that the prophecies in that chapter were about “to be
fulfilled” (Joseph Smith—History 1:40). As you study
these prophecies from Isaiah, reflect upon why Nephi
would record them on the small plates and also why
Moroni would quote them to Joseph Smith.

The Prophet Joseph
Smith received a
revelation that clarified
the meaning of the
prophecies recorded in

2 Nephi 21. Scholars
have long been
fascinated with trying to
understand the meaning
of the symbols used in
this chapter. The Book

of Mormon and modern
prophets have helped us
better understand the
meaning. For example,
Isaiah used the imagery
of a tree or plant. Read

2 Nephi 21:1, 10, and
identify the specific parts
of the tree or plant Isaiah
mentioned. Then read
Doctrine and Covenants
113:1-6 to help you

Using Scripture to
Understand Scripture

Bx
Our books of scripture work
together to help us under-
stand gospel truths and
prophecies. For example, this
lesson refers to Doctrine and
Covenants 113 to help clarify
prophecies and teachings of
Isaiah. Nephi also helped us
understand Isaiah's words.
Elder Bruce R. McConkie of
the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles observed that “the
Book of Mormon is the world’s
greatest commentary on the
book of Isaiah” (“Ten Keys to
Understanding Isaiah,” Ensign,
Oct. 1973, 81).

understand what these symbols mean. It may be
helpful to write the interpretations of the symbols in

your scriptures.

Stem of Jesse—Jesus Christ

Rod out of the stem of Jesse—A servant of Jesus Christ

Root of Jesse—An individual who holds priesthood keys

Consider the following statement by Elder Bruce R.
McConkie, who explained that the “root of Jesse”
and the “rod out of the stem of Jesse” both refer to
the Prophet Joseph Smith: “Are we amiss in saying
that the prophet here mentioned [in D&C 113:5-6]
is Joseph Smith, to whom the priesthood came, who
received the keys of the kingdom, and who raised the
ensign for the gathering of the Lord’s people in our

dispensation? And is he not also the ‘servant in the
hands of Christ, who is partly a descendant of Jesse
as well as of Ephraim, or of the house of Joseph, on
whom there is laid much power’? [D&C 113:3-4]”
(Millennial Messiah [1982], 339-40).

Read 2 Nephi 21:10, 12, and look for what Isaiah
prophesied the Lord would do through the “root
of Jesse” (Joseph Smith). The word ensign refers to
a “standard” to which people gather.

These verses teach the following truth: The Lord has
restored His gospel and His Church through the
Prophet Joseph Smith and is now gathering His
people in the last days.

1. Answer the following question in your scripture study
journal: How is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints an ensign to the world?

2 Nephi 21:6-9; 22:1-6

Isaiah describes the Millennium

One of the most discussed subjects among Christians
is the Savior’s millennial reign. Have you ever thought
much about it? Imagine that a friend asked you what
you believe about the Millennium. What would you say?

Isaiah prophesied that after the Savior’s Second
Coming, there would be changes on the earth that
would last for a thousand years. We call this period of
peace the Millennium. Read 2 Nephi 21:6—9, looking
for what conditions will be like on the earth during the
Millennium.

According to 2 Nephi 21:9, one prophecy about the
Millennium is that “the earth shall be full of the
knowledge of the Lord.” Ponder how the fulfillment
of this prophecy will affect people around the world.
Read 2 Nephi 22:1-6, and notice the spirit of worship
that people will have during the Millennium. How can
we develop that same attitude today?

The verses you have studied teach this truth: During
the Millennium, the earth will be a place of peace
because it will be full of the knowledge of the
Lord. Which aspects of the Millennium would you like
to have in your life right now? Ponder for a moment
what you could do to receive some of these blessings.

You may wish to sing, listen to, or read “The Lord Is
My Light” (Hymns, no. 89) to complement your study
of 2 Nephi 22.

2 Nephi 23-24
Isaiah describes the fall of Babylon, the fall of the wicked,
and the fall of Lucifer

As recorded in 2 Nephi 23-24, Isaiah condemned
the wickedness of the house of Israel and compared
the destruction of the wicked in the last days to the
destruction of ancient Babylon. Babylon was a very
wicked nation in Isaiah’s day and has since come to
symbolize the wickedness of the world (see D&C
133:14).

Study what Isaiah prophesied would happen to the
wicked in the last days by reading 2 Nephi 23:1, 4-9,
11, 15, 19, and 22.

Isaiah also compared the destruction of ancient
Babylon to Lucifer’s (Satan’s) fall from heaven.

He spoke of Lucifer as the symbolic king of Babylon,
meaning the whole wicked world. Isaiah used the
fall of Lucifer in the premortal world as an illustration
of how the wicked would fail and fall. Study 2 Nephi
24:12-14, and mark the phrases that highlight the
arrogance and pride of Satan.

Do you notice the use of the word J in these verses? You
may want to circle the I’s in your scriptures. President
N. Eldon Tanner of the First Presidency once said that
Satan “was more concerned with credit than with
results; glory and praise were the end in themselves”

67
(“For They Loved the Praise of Men More Than the
Praise of God,” Ensign, Nov. 1975, 76).

Search 2 Nephi 24:15-16 for what will ultimately
happen to Satan and how people will feel about him
when they see him for what he is.

Read the following statement by President Ezra Taft
Benson: “In the premortal council, it was pride that
felled Lucifer, ‘a son of the morning.’ (2 Ne. 24:12-15;
see also D&C 76:25-27; Moses 4:3.).. . . Lucifer placed
his proposal in competition with the Father’s plan

as advocated by Jesus Christ. (See Moses 4:1-3.) He
wished to be honored above all others. (See 2 Ne.
24:13.) In short, his prideful desire was to dethrone
God. (See D&C 29:36; 76:28.)” (“Beware of Pride,”
Ensign, May 1989, 4-5).

In 2 Nephi 23:22, we learn that you can take comfort if
you are righteous. God will be merciful to you, but the
wicked will perish.

2 Nephi 25

Introduction

After recording the prophecies of Isaiah (2 Nephi 12—
24), the prophet Nephi emphasized the importance
of these prophecies and explained that those with
the spirit of prophecy can come to understand and
appreciate Isaiah’s words (2 Nephi 25). He explained
that the purpose of his writing was “to persuade our
children, and also our brethren, to believe in Christ,
and to be reconciled to God” (2 Nephi 25:23). He
invited all to believe in Jesus Christ and to “worship

68

him with all your might, mind, and strength, and your
whole soul” (2 Nephi 25:29).

2 Nephi 25:1-8
Nephi teaches that we can understand the words of Isaiah
when we have the spirit of prophecy

People often use locks to keep
valuable possessions safe. They
might keep the only key to the
lock, or they might give a copy
of the key to a trusted friend or
family member. Nephi knew
that the prophecies of Isaiah
were “of great worth”

(2 Nephi 25:8), and he wanted
everyone to understand them.
He provided a key for anyone
who wants to unlock the
meaning of Isaiah’s words.

Read the first sentence in 2 Nephi 25:4, and look for
the key to understanding the words of Isaiah. What
does it mean to have “the spirit of prophecy”? How
do you think the spirit of prophecy could help you
better understand the scriptures, particularly the
words of Isaiah?

The spirit of prophecy refers to the spirit of revelation.
This means that when you diligently and prayerfully
study the scriptures and seek to understand their
meaning, you can have the spirit of revelation,

and the Holy Ghost will enlighten your mind and
your understanding. Also, the scriptures teach that
“the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy”
(Revelation 19:10). As you grow in your knowledge
and testimony of the Savior, your understanding of
the scriptures—including the teachings of Isaiah—
will increase and you will better understand how the
teachings relate to you.

Nephi shared other ideas that can enhance our
understanding of Isaiah’s words. Search the
following scriptures, and identify three more keys to
understanding the words of Isaiah:

e 2 Nephi 25:1

e 2 Nephi 25:5-6

¢ 2 Nephi 25:7-8

Remember that symbolism and poetic language
are often used in ancient Jewish prophecies (see
2 Nephi 25:1). Also, studying the culture, history, and
geography of ancient Israel will help you understand
Isaiah’s words (see 2 Nephi 25:5—-6). Living in the last
days and seeing the fulfillment of many prophecies
also helps us understand Isaiah (see 2 Nephi 25:7-8).

2 Nephi 25:9-19
Nephi prophesies about the Jews

As recorded in 2 Nephi 25:9-19, Nephi prophesied
about the Jews and their homeland in Jerusalem and
the surrounding areas. He said that the Jews who had
been taken captive to Babylon after the destruction
of Jerusalem would return to “the land of their
inheritance” (see 2 Nephi 25:9-11). Jesus Christ, the
Messiah, would live among them, but many would
reject Him and crucify Him (see 2 Nephi 25:12-13).
After the Savior’s death and Resurrection, Jerusalem
would again be destroyed, and the Jews would be
scattered and scourged by other nations (see 2 Nephi
25:14-15). They would eventually believe in Jesus
Christ and His Atonement, and the Lord would
restore them “from their lost and fallen state” (see

2 Nephi 25:16-19).

2 Nephi 25:20-30
Nephi testifies of Jesus Christ

Think about how you might respond to someone who
claims that Latter-day Saints do not believe in Jesus
Christ. As you study the rest of 2 Nephi 25, look for
passages that you could share in such a situation.

Quickly look over 2 Nephi 25:20-30, and consider
marking the name “Christ” each time it appears.

1. Read 2 Nephi 25:28-29, and identify what Nephi

said was “the right way.” Search 2 Nephi 25: 23-26 for
reasons why believing in Jesus Christ is “the right way.” (Note
that 2 Nephi 25:23, 26 is a scripture mastery passage. You may
want to mark it in a distinctive way so you can locate it in the
future.) Record your answers in your scripture study journal.

The word reconciled in 2 Nephi 25:23 means to be
brought into harmony with God. The Lord’s “grace”
is ultimately how reconciliation with God occurs.
Read the following explanation of the Lord’s grace:

“The word grace, as used in the scriptures, refers
primarily to the divine help and strength we receive
through the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ... .

“.,. Through grace, made available by the Savior’s
atoning sacrifice, all people will be resurrected and
receive immortality. [But if we are to qualify for eternal
life in God’s presence, we must be made clean from
our sins through His grace.]

“The phrase ‘after all we can do’ [2 Nephi 25:23]
teaches that effort is required on our part to receive
the fulness of the Lord’s grace and be made worthy
to dwell with Him. The Lord has commanded us to
obey His gospel, which includes having faith in Him,
repenting of our sins, being baptized, receiving the gift
of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end... .

“In addition to needing grace for your ultimate
salvation, you need this enabling power every day of
your life. As you draw near to your Heavenly Father in
diligence, humility, and meekness, He will uplift and
strengthen you through His grace” (True to the Faith:
A Gospel Reference [2004], 77-78).

2. In your scripture study journal, write answers to the
following questions:

a. What is the relationship between the Lord's grace and our
efforts to live the gospel?

b. What does it mean to you to be saved by grace?
c. What does the phrase “all we can do” mean to you?

69
Ponder the following truth: Because of Jesus Christ,
we can be saved by grace after all we can do. Think
of a time when you did all you could do and were
blessed with divine help and strength.

Recall Experiences

| \Z
Recalling experiences when
the Lord blessed you with
help can strengthen you in
difficult moments. Sharing
those experiences by bearing
your testimony, writing in

your journal, or explaining

to someone close to you not
only helps you, but it can
strengthen others who may be
in difficult circumstances and
need support to help them
believe God really exists and
has power to help us.

Another truth Nephi
taught (see 2 Nephi
25:26) is: Through the
Savior’s Atonement,
we can receive a
remission of our sins.

Consider writing a letter
to a friend or family
member about your
belief in Jesus Christ or
testifying of your belief
in a testimony meeting
or other appropriate
setting.

3. Read 2 Nephi
25:26 again, and
then answer the following

questions in your scripture study journal:

a. In what ways do you worship or revere Jesus Christ? What
activities show others that you believe in and worship Jesus Christ?

b. What can you do to better worship the Savior with all your

might, mind, and strength?

2 Nephi 26-27

Introduction

Nephi foresaw Jesus Christ’s visit to the Americas
and the destruction that would later come upon
his people. Nephi also foresaw those living in the
last days and warned them against pride, secret
combinations, and priestcrafts. To illustrate how the
Lord would provide a way for us to overcome the
effects of wickedness and apostasy, Nephi included
Isaiah’s prophecies about the Restoration of the
gospel of Jesus Christ in the latter days.

2 Nephi 26

Nephi prophesies concerning the last days and invites all
to come unto Christ

Have you ever been in an earthquake, severe lightning
storm, or other devastating event or seen photos or
videos of them? Nephi saw that in the latter days

the inhabitants of the earth “shall be visited with
thunderings, and lightnings, and earthquakes, and all
manner of destructions” (2 Nephi 26:6). What comes
to your mind when you read about “the anger of

the Lord” (2 Nephi 26:6) or “the judgments of God”
(2 Nephi 25:3)? God’s judgments are intended to bless
His children—to bring the wicked to repentance and
to protect the righteous. In 2 Nephi 26:1-11, Nephi
prophesied of destructions that would precede Jesus
Christ’s visit to the Americas and of the eventual
destruction of his people because of their wickedness.
Read 2 Nephi 26:8-9, and look for blessings that Nephi
said would come to his righteous descendants. Then
read 2 Nephi 26:12—13, and look for what is promised
to us as we exercise faith in Jesus Christ.

1. Jesus Christ manifests Himself to those who exercise

faith in Him and endure in righteousness. Record your
answers to the following questions in your scripture study
journal:

a. How does Jesus Christ manifest Himself to those who
exercise faith in Him? (See 2 Nephi 26:13.)

b. How have you witnessed or experienced some of these
manifestations of Jesus Christ?

In 2 Nephi 26:14-19, Nephi prophesied that in the
latter days, after his people and the seed of his brothers
are weakened by unbelief, the Book of Mormon would
come forth. In 2 Nephi 26:20-22, he described how
many people in the latter days will be full of pride,
reject the miracles of God, and rely on their own
wisdom and learning. In what ways have you seen
examples of Nephi’s prophecy being fulfilled?

Nephi warned us that the devil uses pride, greed, and
secret works to ruin or destroy us. In your scriptures
by 2 Nephi 26:22, mark how Satan seeks to bind us.
A flaxen cord is a thin linen thread that can easily be
broken. However, when multiple threads are woven
together they become a strong cord. Read 2 Nephi
26:32, and notice the examples of “works of darkness”
that the Lord commands us to avoid. Ponder how a
single strand of thread can become the “strong cords”
in 2 Nephi 26:32.

2. Imagine you are teaching a friend how to avoid the

traps of the devil (Satan). Using 2 Nephi 26:20-22, 32,
write a paragraph in your scripture study journal that explains the
process by which the devil seeks to bind us. Specifically notice in
2 Nephi 26:22 how the adversary uses flaxen cords until his victim
is bound with stronger cords, and give an example.

Nephi saw the destruction caused by the adversary and
warned of Satan’s traps and influences in the last days.
In contrast to Satan’s works of darkness, Nephi taught
that God's love is extended to all and that His purpose

is to save as many as will come unto Him. Read 2 Nephi

26:23-24, and highlight words and phrases that describe
how God works with His children. According to 2 Nephi
26:24, what is God’s purpose in everything He does?
You may want to highlight the phrase that teaches this
doctrine: Everything the Lord does is for the benefit
of the world.

3. Answer the following question in your scripture study

journal: How does understanding that everything the Lord
does is for the benefit of the world help you increase your faith in
our Heavenly Father and give you peace and assurance in this life?

Skim through 2 Nephi 26:25-28, 33, and mark each
time the words all, any, and none appear. Then go back
and reread these verses, paying special attention to
these words and how Nephi taught that the Lord
loves all people and invites all to come unto Him
and partake of His salvation. Ponder how this
principle affects the way you view commandments,
standards, and other people.

4. Read 2 Nephi 26:29-31. In your scripture study
journal, list two or three characteristics of priestcrafts
listed in verse 29, and then answer the following questions:

a. Why do you think priestcrafts are damaging to the Church?

b. According to 2 Nephi 26:30, how are priestcrafts prevented?

2 Nephi 27:1-23
Nephi prophesies of the coming forth of the Book of
Mormon

5. Answer the following question in your scripture study
journal: How do you know (or why do you believe) that
the Book of Mormon is the word of God?

71
The Lord revealed to the prophet Isaiah details
conceming the coming forth of the Book of Mormon,
which Nephi recorded in 2 Nephi 27. After Isaiah
prophesied that in the last days many people would
be full of iniquity and reject the prophets, he taught
that God would reveal a book of ancient writings (see
2 Nephi 27:1-7). Read 2 Nephi 27:12-14, and look for
what it teaches the Lord would do to establish the truth
of the book that would come forth in the last days.

One way the Lord established the truthfulness of the
Book of Mormon was to allow other individuals to be
witnesses of the gold plates. Oliver Cowdery, David
Whitmer, and Martin Harris were selected as the
Three Witnesses and are referred to in 2 Nephi 27:12.
(See “The Testimony of Three Witnesses” at the front
of the Book of Mormon.)

The “few” referred to in 2 Nephi 27:13 included

the Eight Witnesses (see “The Testimony of Eight
Witnesses” at the front of the Book of Mormon).
Consider marking the phrase “as many witnesses as
seemeth him good” in 2 Nephi 27:14. As you receive
and share your testimony of the Book of Mormon, you
also become a witness of the truthfulness of this book.
You might want to write your name by 2 Nephi 27:14
as one of these additional witnesses of the truthfulness
of the Book of Mormon.

Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles said of his own witness of the Book of
Mormon:

“T testify that one cannot come to full
faith in this latter-day work—and thereby
find the fullest measure of peace and
comfort in these, our times—until he or
she embraces the divinity of the Book of
Mormon and the Lord Jesus Christ, of
whom it testifies... .

“Task that my testimony of the Book of Mormon and
all that it implies, given today under my own oath
and office, be recorded by men on earth and angels
in heaven....1 want it absolutely clear when I stand
before the judgment bar of God that I declared to the
world, in the most straightforward language | could
summon, that the Book of Mormon is true, that it
came forth the way Joseph said it came forth and was
given to bring happiness and hope to the faithful in
the travail of the latter days” (“Safety for the Soul,”
Ensign, Nov. 2009, 89-90).

Reflect on what you can do to strengthen your
conviction of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon.

72

6. In your scripture study journal, write down what you
will do this year to strengthen your witness of the
truthfulness of the Book of Mormon.

To complete the following activity, you will need to
refer to Joseph Smith—History, which is in the Pearl of
Great Price. Read Joseph Smith—History 1:63--65, and
identify the individuals in the account. Then read the
assigned passages from 2 Nephi 27 in the chart below,
and match a name to each set of verses.

a. Charles Anthon
b. Joseph Smith
c. Martin Harris

_____ The unlearned man (see

2 Nephi 27:9, 15, 19-20)

_____ The man who takes the words,
or characters, to the learned man (see
2 Nephi 27:15, 17)

____ The learned man (see 2 Nephi
27:15, 18)

The word characters in Joseph Smith—History

1:63-65 refers to the reformed Egyptian characters
Joseph Smith had copied and translated from the

gold plates that Martin Harris presented to Professor
Charles Anthon. Charles Anthon was an instructor at
Columbia College and a man who had a reputation for
knowing ancient languages. After stating and certifying
in writing that Joseph Smith’s translation of the
characters was correct, Professor Anthon tore up his
endorsement of the translation when he was told of
the miraculous way the plates had been obtained. He
offered to translate the record himself. When Martin
Harris explained that some of the plates were sealed,
Professor Anthon said he could not read a sealed book.
According to 2 Nephi 27:16, what do we learn about
Charles Anthon’s motive for wanting to translate the
plates?

Read 2 Nephi 27:20—23, and mark the phrase that is
repeated in verses 20 and 21.

7. Write in your scripture study journal how what you

have studied so far in 2 Nephi 27:1-23 confirms that God
is able to do His work. (If you need additional information about
the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, see D&C 20:8-12.)

You may want to write the following truth in your
scriptures: The coming forth of the Book of
Mormon is one of the ways God will accomplish
His work in the latter days.

8. Respond to the following question in your scripture
study journal: How does the fulfillment of the ancient

prophecy about the Book of Mormon strengthen your testimony
of the book and its role in the Restoration of the Lord’s Church?

2 Nephi 27:24-35
Nephi prophesies of the positive impact of the restored
gospel of Jesus Christ

God chose a young man named Joseph Smith to be
the prophet of the Restoration and bring about His
marvelous work in the last days. The “marvelous work”
referred to in the scriptures is the Restoration of the
gospel of Jesus Christ, which includes the coming
forth of the Book of Mormon. Read 2 Nephi 27:25-26,
mark the phrase “marvelous work and a wonder,” and
identify some of the conditions that would exist when
the Lord began this marvelous work. Ponder how the
Book of Mormon and the Restoration have helped you
avoid those conditions.

73
Read 2 Nephi 27:29-30, 34-35, and mark the blessings
that come because of the coming forth of the Book of
Mormon and Restoration of the gospel. The Book of
Mormon and the restored gospel will bring joy and

understanding to those who study and accept them.

9. Record your answer to the following question in your

scripture study journal: How has the Restoration of the
gospel, which includes the coming forth of the Book of Mormon,
been a “marvelous work” in your life?

2 Nephi 28

Introduction

Nephi prophesied of some of the challenging
conditions of the latter days, including the false
teachings and pride of false churches that would be
built up. He teaches how to recognize false doctrines
and worldly attitudes and identifies ways Satan will
endeavor to distract men and women from a life of
righteousness.

2 Nephi 28:1-19
Nephi describes false churches and false ideas of our day

In most cultures there are traffic signs warning travelers
when any danger is ahead on the road or path. In the
country and town where you live, what shape and color
are traffic signs that alert drivers to a danger that lies
ahead? Similarly, poisons and other hazardous materials
are usually marked with symbols and warnings on the
packaging and containers. How are these items marked
where you live?

Like these physical warning signs, the Book of
Mormon contains warnings to help you avoid
influences that are harmful to your spirit. President
Ezra Taft Benson identified how the Book of Mormon
can warn and strengthen you against Satan’s evil
designs: “The Book of Mormon exposes the enemies
of Christ. It confounds false doctrines and lays
down contention. (See 2 Ne. 3:12.) It fortifies the

74

humble followers of Christ against the evil designs,
strategies, and doctrines of the devil in our day. The
type of apostates in the Book of Mormon are similar
to the type we have today. God, with his infinite
foreknowledge, so molded the Book of Mormon that
we might see the error and know how to combat false
educational, political, religious, and philosophical
concepts of our time” (“The Book of Mormon Is the
Word of God,” Ensign, Jan. 1988, 3).

The Book of Mormon exposes the false ideas of the
devil and strengthens us against his evil designs. As
recorded in 2 Nephi 28, Nephi pointed out some of the
false teachings of the devil common in all generations.
Search 2 Nephi 28:3—-9, and mark the false teachings
and deceptions of Satan you learn about there. (Note
that 2 Nephi 28:7—9 is a scripture mastery passage. You
may want to mark it in a distinctive way so you can
locate it in the future.)

1. In your scripture study journal, record from 2 Nephi

28:3-9 one of the false teachings you think is most
damaging to the youth today, and explain your reasons. Also
include an example of how young people can become enticed
by that false teaching.

Read 2 Nephi 28:12-14, and look for what Nephi
warned would happen to many churches and people,
even some of “the humble followers of Christ”

(verse 14). These things are caused by the pride and the
false doctrine you read about in 2 Nephi 28:3-9. Read
2 Nephi 28:15-16, 19, and identify some consequences
of these false teachings. You may want to mark the
phrase in 2 Nephi 28:19 that explains what the devil
will do with those who do not repent.

LJ Scripture Mastery—2 Nephi 28:7-9

2. Read aloud 2 Nephi 28:7—9. Spend some time

memorizing 2 Nephi 28:8. You might want to write it in
your scripture study journal from memory or recite it to a family
member or friend. In the last days many people will teach false,
vain, and foolish doctrines. In your scripture study journal, list a
few ways these foolish doctrines are promoted and briefly explain
how you can recognize the foolish doctrines of the world and
avoid them.

2 Nephi 28:20-32
Nephi warns of Satan's deception

As preparation for your study of the remainder of

2 Nephi 28, read the following experience of President
Boyd K. Packer, President of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles, when he was visiting a wildlife reserve while
on an assignment in Africa:
“We stopped at a water hole to watch the animals
come to drink. It was very dry that season and there
was not much water, really just muddy spots... .

“The antelope, particularly, were very
nervous. They would approach the mud
hole, only to turn and run away in great
fright. I could see there were no lions
about and asked the guide why they
didn’t drink. His answer, and this is the
lesson, was ‘Crocodiles.’

“T knew he must be joking and asked him seriously,
‘What is the problem?’ The answer again: ‘Crocodiles.’

“’Nonsense,’ I said. ‘There are no crocodiles out there.
Anyone can see that.’...

“He could tell I did not believe him and determined,
I suppose, to teach me a lesson. We drove to another
location where the car was on an embankment above
the muddy hole where we could look down. ‘There,’
he said. ‘See for yourself.’

“T couldn't see anything except the mud, a little water,
and the nervous animals in the distance. Then all at
once I saw it!—a large crocodile, settled in the mud,
waiting for some unsuspecting animal to get thirsty
enough to come for a drink.

“Suddenly I became a believer! When he could see
I was willing to listen, he continued with the lesson.
‘There are crocodiles all over the park,’ he said, ‘not
just in the rivers. We don’t have any water without a
crocodile somewhere near it, and you'd better count
onit.’...

“On another trip to Africa I discussed this experience
with a game ranger in another park... .

“He then showed me a place where a tragedy had
occurred. A young man from England was working
in the hotel for the season. In spite of constant and
repeated warnings, he went through the compound
fence to check something across a shallow splash of
water that didn’t cover his tennis shoes.

“He wasnt two steps in,’ the ranger said, ‘before a
crocodile had him, and we could do nothing to save
him’” (“Spiritual Crocodiles,” Ensign, May 1976,
30-31).

What is the danger of doubting the existence of
crocodiles when you can’t see them? How is President
Packer’s and the young man’s experience like what
Nephi described in 2 Nephi 28:22?

President Packer explained:

“Those ahead of you in life have probed about the
water holes a bit and raise a voice of warning about

crocodiles. Not just the big, gray lizards that can bite
you to pieces, but spiritual crocodiles, infinitely more
dangerous, and more deceptive and less visible, even,
than those well-camouflaged reptiles of Africa.

“These spiritual crocodiles can kill or mutilate your
souls. They can destroy your peace of mind and the
peace of mind of those who love you. Those are
the ones to be warned against, and there is hardly
a watering place in all of mortality now that is not
infested with them (“Spiritual Crocodiles,” 31).

On the following lines, answer the following question:
In what ways might the crocodiles in Africa be similar
to the temptations and tactics of Satan?

Read 2 Nephi 28:20-21, 24-26, and look for ways Satan
seeks to destroy us. (It may be helpful to know that the
word pacify in 2 Nephi 28:21 means to calm, lull, or put
to sleep spiritually.) According to these verses, what
methods does Satan use to try to pacify us and lead us
into his power?

A major principle taught in these verses is: Satan
uses many tactics to try to overpower us, such
as by stirring us up to anger, pacifying us and
lulling us, and flattering us.

3. Answer one or more of the following questions in
your scripture study journal:

a. How does Satan use anger to deceive and destroy individuals,
families, and communities?

b. What are some good things that Satan has enticed
individuals to be angry toward?

c. Describe at least two examples of how some people have
been pacified and become blinded to the dangers of Satan.

Read the following explanation from
Bishop Richard C. Edgley, a counselor

in the Presiding Bishopric, regarding the
gradual process that Satan uses to trap us:
“We cannot say we will sow a few wild
oats in our youth or that we will just
dabble a little around the fringes of sin. There are no
fringes of sin. Every act, good or bad, has a
consequence. Every good act improves our ability to

do good and more firmly stand against sin or failure.
Every transgression, regardless of how minor, makes us
more susceptible to Satan’s influence the next time he
tempts us. Satan takes us an inch at a time, deceiving
us as to the consequences of so-called minor sins until
he captures us in major transgressions. Nephi describes
this technique as one of pacifying, lulling, and flattering
us away until Satan ‘grasps [us] with his awful chains,

75
from whence there is no deliverance’ (2 Ne. 28:22;
see also v. 21)” (“That Thy Confidence Wax Strong,”
Ensign, Nov. 1994, 40).

Satan uses these subtle tactics to persuade us to think,
say, and do wrong things. Read 2 Nephi 28:27-29, and
look for additional warnings.

The Lord gave another warning and blessing, which
is included near the end of this chapter. Read 2 Nephi
28:30-32, and ponder the following questions:

Why does God call some people blessed? How will
hearkening to God’s counsel help us overcome the
devil’s tactics?

4. Inyour scripture study journal, write about what you

have learned from this lesson that will help you overcome
Satan’s tactics. What are some places, activities, or attitudes you
want to avoid so you are not exposed to Satan's influence?

5. Think about the discussion on warning signs at the

beginning of this lesson. In your scripture study journal,
draw a warning sign that illustrates a spiritual danger you think
youth need to be warned of today. Be prepared to share this with
your teacher and class members.

2 Nephi 29-30

Introduction

Nephi’s message about the marvelous work of the
Restoration of the gospel continues in 2 Nephi 29-30.
He testified that in the last days all scriptures will work
together to show all nations, kindreds, tongues, and
people that the Lord remembers His children. These
records are a witness and testimony that Jesus Christ
is our Savior. Nephi prophesied that many will reject
the Book of Mormon but those who believe will be
gathered into the Church. In addition, Nephi taught
that God’s covenant people are those who repent and
believe in the Son of God.

76

2 Nephi 29:1-14
The Lord tells Nephi that in the last days many will reject
the Book of Mormon

Nephi saw that many people in the latter days would
believe the Bible to be the only book of scripture revealed
from God and would reject the Book of Mormon. How
would you respond if you had a friend ask, “Why do
Mormons have another Bible?”

Nephi provided some answers to this question by
recording the Lord’s words about the role of the Book
of Mormon in the latter-day Restoration of the gospel,
which the Lord called “a marvelous work” (2 Nephi
29:1). Read 2 Nephi 29:1-2, and identify what the
Lord’s words would do in the last days. (They would
“proceed forth” to Nephi’s seed, or descendants,

and they would also “hiss forth unto the ends of

the earth.”) To “hiss” means to “whistle,” which

is suggestive of a signal to gather (see Isaiah 5:26,
footnote b).

The word standard in 2 Nephi 29:2 refers to an object
used to gather and unify people. Flags are often
called standards. According to 2 Nephi 29:2, what is
the standard that will go forth “unto the ends of the
earth” to gather the Lord’s people? (You may want to
write something like The Book of Mormon—the words
of Nephi’s seed, or descendants next to 2 Nephi 29:2.)

1. Write in your scripture study journal what, according
to 2 Nephi 29:1—2, the Lord’s purpose is for providing
additional scripture such as the Book of Mormon.

Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of
the Twelve Apostles shared the following
insight regarding the Book of Mormon:
“The Book of Mormon is the preeminent
statement of God’s covenant with and his
love for his children here on earth” (Christ
and the New Covenant: The Messianic Message of the Book
of Mormon [1997], 4).

In 2 Nephi 29 the word Gentiles refers to people who are
not of the house of Israel. The word Jews refers to people
who are of the house of Israel, including Lehi’s family
and descendants. Read 2 Nephi 29:36, looking for the
reaction some Gentiles would have toward additional
scripture. Write your answers to the following questions
in the space provided.

How will some react to additional scripture?

What did the Lord say about people who react this
way?

Nephi was prophetic in his description of people’s
reaction to the Book of Mormon. People today often
express doubts about the Book of Mormon because
they already have the Bible. Highlight words or phrases
in 2 Nephi 29:7-11 that describe the Lord’s purposes
for giving additional scripture. Think about how

you might explain these purposes to someone who
does not understand the need or value of receiving
additional revelation from God.

2. Using what you marked in 2 Nephi 29:7-11, write a

response in your scripture study journal to the question
presented at the beginning of this lesson: “Why do Mormons
have another Bible?”

The Lord provides scriptures as a second witness
and to gather people to His covenant. Read 2 Nephi
29:13-14, and look for the blessing that results when
the scriptures—“the words of the Nephites” (the Book
of Mormon), “the words of the Jews” (the Bible), and
“the words of the lost tribes of Israel”—are had among
the people.

2 Nephi 30:1-8
Nephi prophesies of the role of the Book of Mormon in the
last days

After teaching that God would remember the house
of Israel, Nephi cautioned his people not to think they

were more righteous than the Gentiles would be. He
also reminded them that all people can become God’s
covenant people. Read 2 Nephi 30:2, and in the space
provided write two things people need to do before the
Lord will enter into covenants with them.

Take a moment and ponder the effect the Book of
Mormon has had on you or someone you are close to.
Then read 2 Nephi 30:3-8, and complete the following
activity with phrases describing the impact of the Book
of Mormon on those who receive it.

Groups of People The Impact of the Book of

Mormon

Descendants of Lehi (2 Nephi
30:3-6)

Jews (2 Nephi 30:7)

Gentiles, or all nations
(2 Nephi 30:8)

Read the following statement from President Henry B.
Eyring of the First Presidency and highlight reasons why
the Book of Mormon is a powerful missionary tool:

“The Book of Mormon has been at the
center of missionary work since the
gospel was restored through the Prophet
Joseph. We use it every day in missionary
work. One fact about the Book of
Mormon being the key to power in each
part of missionary work is this: the Book of Mormon is
a testament of Jesus Christ. The title page tells us that.
It says that the purpose of the book is to show what
great things the Lord has done for His people, to help
them know that the covenants the Lord has made with
His people are still in force, and to convince all people
that Jesus is the Christ” (“Why the Book of Mormon?”
New Era, May 2008, 6, 8).

Studying 2 Nephi 30:1-8 shows us that the Book of
Mormon can help all people come to know Jesus
Christ and live His gospel.

3. Select one of the following questions to answer in
your scripture study journal:

a. How has the Book of Mormon helped you come to know the
Savior?

b. How will you use the Book of Mormon to help others come
to know the Savior?

77
2 Nephi 30:9-18
Nephi prophesies of conditions of the earth during the
Millennium

Read 2 Nephi 30:9-10, and look for what will happen
among the people before the Millennium—the 1,000
years of righteousness and peace following the Saviors
Second Coming, when Jesus Christ shall “reign
personally upon the earth” (Articles of Faith 1:10).
How have you seen a “great division” (2 Nephi 30:10)
separating the righteous from the wicked? What will
eventually happen to the wicked?

Read 2 Nephi 30:12-18, looking for what life will be
like during the Millennium.

4. Inyour scripture study journal, write a newspaper

headline (a highlight or summary in a few words)
describing the millennial condition you most look forward to.
After you have written a headline, explain how that headline is
an indication of the peace that will prevail on the earth during
the Millennium.

Consider what it will be like when Satan will not
have power over the hearts of people during the
Millennium, and righteousness and peace will
prevail. Think about how your school or community
would be different if those conditions prevailed today.

5. Write in your scripture study journal about what you
can do to help yourself, your family, and others prepare
for this period of peace and righteousness.

Commentary and Background Information

How Will Additional Scriptural Records Come Forth?

Elder Bruce R. McConkie of the Quorum
of the Twelve Apostles suggested that the
records spoken of in 2 Nephi 29:12-14
would “come forth in a marvelous
manner, at the direction of the president
of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints, who is a revelator and a translator and who
holds the keys of the kingdom of God” (The Millennial
Messiah [1982], 217). We know that the Savior visited
some of the lost tribes of Israel after His Resurrection
and visit to the Nephites and that they will also write
accounts of His ministry among them after His
resurrection (see 3 Nephi 16:1-3; 17:4).

When Will the “Jews... Begin to Believe in Christ”?

Elder Bruce R. McConkie also discussed the prophesied
conversion of the Jews:

78

“And it shall come to pass that the Jews which are
scattered also shall begin to believe in Christ; and they
shall begin to gather in upon the face of the land.’ (2
Ne. 30:7.) Much of the old Jewish bitterness against
Christ has ceased; many now accept him as a great
Rabbi, though not the Son of God. A few have
accepted him in the full sense, coming into the true
Church along with the gathered remnants of Ephraim
and his fellows.

“But the great conversion of the Jews, their return to
the truth as a nation, is destined to follow the Second
Coming of their Messiah. Those able to abide that day,
in their extremity and mourning, will ask: “What are
these wounds in thine hands and in thy feet? Then
shall they know that Iam the Lord; for I will say unto
them: These wounds are the wounds with which I was
wounded in the house of my friends. | am he who was
lifted up. 1 am Jesus that was crucified. Iam the Son of
God (D. & C. 45:51-52; Zech. 12:8-14; 13:6.)”
(Mormon Doctrine, 2nd ed. [1966], 722-23).

Additional questions, thoughts, and insights | would like to share
with my teacher:

2 Nephi 31

Introduction

Nephi taught the doctrine of Christ: we must exercise
faith in Jesus Christ, repent of our sins, be baptized,
receive the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end. He
also testified that as we apply these teachings, God
will bless us with the companionship of the Holy
Ghost and lead us to eternal life.

2 Nephi 31:1-21

Nephi teaches that the Savior set the perfect example for us
Jesus went to John the Baptist to be baptized. Since
Jesus did not commit any sins, why do you think He

was baptized? Why were you baptized? Pondering
these questions will help you prepare for this lesson.
Read 2 Nephi 31:2, 21, and mark the phrase “doctrine
of Christ.” Notice that in verse 2, Nephi stated that
he “must speak concerning the doctrine of Christ.”
Then in verse 21 he said that he had spoken of “the
doctrine of Christ.” In 2 Nephi 31:3-20 we learn about
those truths that Nephi called “the doctrine of Christ.”
Two truths we learn are: Jesus Christ fulfilled all
righteousness by obeying all the commandments
of the Father, and we must follow Jesus Christ’s
example of obedience by being baptized and
receiving the Holy Ghost.

1. Write the following headings in parallel columns in

your scripture study journal: Reasons Why Jesus Was
Baptized and Reasons Why We Are Baptized. Then read 2 Nephi
31:4-12, and list what you learn under each of those headings.

According to 2 Nephi 31:11, what must precede
baptism?

To help explain why baptism by water is required, read
the following statement by the Prophet Joseph Smith:

“Baptism is a sign to God, to angels, and to heaven
that we do the will of God, and there is no other way
beneath the heavens whereby God hath ordained

for man to come to Him to be saved, and enter into
the kingdom of God, except faith in Jesus Christ,
repentance, and baptism for the remission of sins, and
any other course is in vain; then you have the promise
of the gift of the Holy Ghost” (Teachings of Presidents of
the Church: Joseph Smith [2007], 91).

2. Imagine that a friend who is not a member of the
Church asked you why baptism is so important. Write
how you would respond in your scripture study journal.

3. Write in your scripture study journal how following
the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized has
influenced and blessed your life.

There is more for us to do after we are baptized. Read
2 Nephi 31:13, and mark the phrases that describe
the attitude someone should have as they follow the
Savior’s example.

According to 2 Nephi 31:13, when we fulfill our
covenant with full purpose of heart and with real
intent, what does our Father in Heaven promise us in
return? (You may want to mark this in your scriptures.)
Read the last phrase in 2 Nephi 31:17, and identify
why we need to receive the Holy Ghost. In the space
provided, write a doctrinal statement or a principle
based on scripture that explains what the Holy Ghost
will do for us.

Fire is used to purify materials such as metals. It burns
out impurities, leaving behind a cleaner material. This
is similar to what happens to us spiritually when we
receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. It is also known as
the “baptism of fire” (see 2 Nephi 31:13). The Holy
Ghost witnesses of the Father and the Son and
brings a remission of sins. President Marion G.
Romney of the First Presidency taught, “This baptism
of fire and of the Holy Ghost . . . cleanses, heals, and
purifies the soul” (Learning for the Eternities, comp.
George J. Romney [1977], 133).

To find another component of the “doctrine of Christ,”
read 2 Nephi 31:15-16, and highlight what you find.
Relate the phrases you discovered in 2 Nephi 31:13 to
the instruction given in 2 Nephi 31:15-16, and think
about how you can endure to the end with “real intent”
and “full purpose of heart.”

4. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

79
un

a. How might the terms “with full purpose of heart,” “acting
no hypocrisy,” and “with real intent” apply to such activities as
daily scripture study or Church attendance?

b. What is the difference between someone who “says their
prayers” and someone who prays "with full purpose of heart”?

c. What is the difference between someone who “partakes of
the sacrament” and someone who partakes of the sacrament
“with real intent”?

Read 2 Nephi 31:18, and look for where we are after
we pass through the gate of repentance and baptism.
When we exercise faith, repent, are baptized, and
receive the Holy Ghost, we enter into the “strait and
narrow path.” Strait means narrow, strict, exacting, and
allowing for no deviation. According to 2 Nephi 31:18,
how can we know if we are on the strait and narrow
path?

Experiencing the gift of the Holy Ghost is not simply
a nice feeling we receive from time to time. The
companionship of the Holy Ghost is a witness from
God that we are on the path leading to eternal life.

5. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. How has the companionship of the Holy Ghost helped you
stay on the strait and narrow path?

b. In what other ways has the Holy Ghost blessed your life?

Read 2 Nephi 31:19-21,
and make a list by

scriptures other things
we must do in order to
stay on the path. (Note

scriptures, you may want
to mark them to help you

understand what the Lord and
His prophets are teaching.

Elder Russell M. Nelson of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles offered this hopeful counsel to those who feel
they have strayed from the strait and narrow path: “In
your journey through life, you meet many obstacles and
make some mistakes. Scriptural guidance helps you

to recognize error and make the necessary correction.
You stop going in the wrong direction. You carefully
study the scriptural road map. Then you proceed with
repentance and restitution required to get on the ‘strait
and narrow path which leads to eternal life’ [2 Nephi
31:18]” (“Living by Scriptural Guidance,” Ensign, Nov.
2000, 17).

Ponder how this statement and the scriptures you
studied today bring you a “brightness of hope”
(2 Nephi 31:20).

CL) Scripture Mastery—2 Nephi 31:19-20

7. Spend five minutes working to memorize 2 Nephi

31:20. Have a family member or friend test your
knowledge of the scripture, or you may choose to cover the verse
up with your hand and try to quote it without looking at it. Try
writing the verse from memory in your scripture study journal.

8. Using 2 Nephi 31:20, select one of the things we

must do to stay on the correct path that you are doing
well. Then write a description in your scripture study journal of
how you are doing it. Then select one area you would like to
improve in, and write how you will do that.

Commentary and Background Information

How can we avoid hypocrisy?

Nephi warned against hypocrisy in 2 Nephi 31:13.
Hypocrisy means to pretend or play a part for others
to see that does not reflect our true identity. Elder
Joseph B. Wirthlin of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles spoke of acting with no hypocrisy:

“Do we, indeed, actually live the gospel,
or do we just manifest the appearance of
righteousness so that those around us
assume we are faithful when, in reality,
our hearts and unseen actions are not
true to the Lord’s teachings?

“Do we take on only the ‘form of godliness’ while
denying the ‘power thereof’ [see Joseph Smith—
History 1:19]?

“Are we righteous in fact, or do we feign [pretend]
obedience only when we think others are watching?

“The Lord has made it clear that He will not be fooled
by appearances, and He has warned us not to be false

to Him or to others. He has cautioned us to be wary of
those who project a false front, who put on a bright
pretense that hides a darker reality. We know that the
Lord ‘looketh on the heart’ and not on the ‘outward
appearance’ [see 1 Samuel 16:7]” (“True to the Truth,”
Ensign, May 1997, 15-16).

How do we “endure to the end”?

The term “endure to the end” (2 Nephi 31:16) is
frequently used to suggest the need to patiently suffer
hardships throughout our lives. Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin
explained that to endure to the end also means to
continue in faithfulness to Christ until the end of our
lives:

“Enduring to the end is the doctrine of continuing on
the path leading to eternal life after one has entered
into the path through faith, repentance, baptism, and
receiving the Holy Ghost. Enduring to the end requires
our whole heart. . . .

“Enduring to the end means that we have planted our
lives firmly on gospel soil, staying in the mainstream of
the Church, humbly serving our fellow men, living
Christlike lives, and keeping our covenants. Those who
endure are balanced, consistent, humble, constantly
improving, and without guile. Their testimony is not
based on worldly reasons—it is based on truth,
knowledge, experience, and the Spirit” (“Press On,”
Ensign, Nov. 2004, 101).

Additional questions, thoughts, and insights | would like to share
with my teacher:

2 Nephi 32

Introduction

After teaching about the “strait and narrow path
which leads to eternal life” (2 Nephi 31:18), Nephi
saw that his people wondered what they should

do after beginning on that path. He answered their
questions by encouraging them to “feast upon the
words of Christ” and “pray always” (2 Nephi 32:3, 9).
He assured them that if they would do these things,
the Holy Ghost would help them know what to do.

2 Nephi 32:1-7
Nephi counsels us to seek divine direction through the
words of Jesus Christ

Think of a time when someone gave you directions to
get from one place to another. Was it easy or difficult
to understand those directions? Why is it important
to have someone give clear directions?

In the previous lesson you studied some directions
Nephi gave his people. After sharing these directions,
he said, “This is the way” (2 Nephi 31:21). Quickly
search 2 Nephi 31:17-18, and review how someone
gets started on the path to eternal life. Then read

2 Nephi 32:1, and look for a question that was in the
hearts of the people regarding what Nephi had taught
them. Describe the people’s question in your own
words:

Read 2 Nephi 32:2—3, and look for what Nephi said
we need to do after we have entered the path. It may
be helpful to know that speaking with the tongue

of angels, according to President Boyd K. Packer,
President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles,
“simply means that you can speak with the power of
the Holy Ghost” (“The Gift of the Holy Ghost: What
Every Member Should Know,” Ensign, Aug. 2006, 50).

You may want to mark the phrase “feast upon the
words of Christ” in 2 Nephi 32:3 (this verse is a
scripture mastery passage). Nephi used the phrase “the
words of Christ” to describe teachings inspired by the
Holy Ghost. List some ways or places you can read,
hear, or receive teachings inspired by the Holy Ghost.

The words of Christ include the scriptures and the
words of modern-day prophets. To help you ponder
what it might mean to “feast upon the words of
Christ,” read the following quotations:

Elder Russell M. Nelson of the Quorum
of the Twelve Apostles taught: “To feast
means more than to taste. To feast means
to savor. We savor the scriptures by
studying them in a spirit of delightful
discovery and faithful obedience. When
we feast upon the words of Christ, they . .. become an
integral part of our nature” (“Living by Scriptural
Guidance,” Ensign, Nov. 2000, 17).

Elder Robert D. Hales of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles said: “If you and | are to feast upon the words
of Christ, we must study the scriptures and absorb His
words through pondering them and making them a
part of every thought and action” (“Healing Soul and
Body,” Ensign, Nov. 1998, 15).

81
1. In your scripture study journal, write in your own
words what you think it means to feast upon the words
of Christ.

Ponder the difference between the words feast, snack,
and starve. Think for a moment about how some
less-effective ways of studying the words of Christ
might be compared to snacking or even starving.

Fill in the rest of the following principle according to
2 Nephi 32:3: When we feast on the words of Christ,
the words of Christ will

2. In your scripture study journal, either write about a

time when feasting on the words of Christ helped you
know what to do in your life or describe a situation you now
face where feasting on the words of Christ could help you.

Fill in the blanks below to evaluate how well you are
feasting on the words of Christ and how you might
improve. In each of the examples below, write the
word—feast, snack, or starve—that best describes
how well you seek to know the words of Christ in
that setting. For example, you might feast on the
scriptures in your personal study but only smack on
the words of Christ in general conference.

Personal scripture study:

Sacrament meeting:

General conference:

Family scripture study:

Seminary:

Family home evening:

Aaronic Priesthood quorum meeting or Young Women
class:

Sunday School:

Personal prayer:

3. Take a moment to choose one of the activities for

which you wrote that you currently “snack” or “starve.”
In your scripture study journal, write how you will better feast on
the words of Christ in that setting. Then follow through and do it.

Read 2 Nephi 32:4—7, and ponder answers to the
following questions (you will be writing your answer
to one of the questions for assignment 4):

e In verse 4, what do you think it means to “ask” or
“knock”? How might prayer be a good example of
asking or knocking?

82

e Also in verse 4, what did Nephi say are the
consequences for those who will not ask or knock?

e Inverse 5, what blessing did Nephi promise we can
have when we receive the Holy Ghost?

e Inverse 7, what attitudes did Nephi’s people have
that led him to mourn for them? Why do you think
these attitudes keep people from searching and
understanding “great knowledge”?

4. Write in your scripture study journal one truth you
learned from 2 Nephi 32:4-7, and explain why this truth

is important in your life.

CJ Scripture Mastery—2 Nephi 32:3

5. How long do you think it might take you to memorize

2 Nephi 32:3 if you recite it each time you eat food? Write
the verse on a card or small piece of paper, and carry it with you.
For the next few days, feast on the words of Christ by seeking to
memorize 2 Nephi 32:3 before and after each meal you eat. In your
scripture study journal, report on how many meals it took for you

to memorize the scripture.

2 Nephi 32:8-9

Nephi counsels us to pray always

Many people say that after they have sinned they

do not want to pray to Heavenly Father. Think for a
moment about why this might be. Who would not
want you to pray anytime, especially after you had
sinned? Why? Look in 2 Nephi 32:8 for what the
Holy Ghost teaches us to do regarding prayer. Ponder
the following questions: Why do you think the Lord
wants you to pray? Why do you think Satan does not

want you to pray?

Read 2 Nephi 32:9, and
look for how often we
should pray and what
blessings the Lord
promises us if we pray.
As you read this verse, it
may be helpful to know
that consecrate means to
dedicate to the service
of God or to make holy.

From 2 Nephi 32:9 we
learn this principle:
As we pray always,
we will be able to do
all the Lord would

Evaluating Our Lives

When we take the time

to honestly evaluate how
well we are living a certain
principle, we give the Holy
Ghost the opportunity to
help us realize what we are
doing well and how we can
improve. As you evaluate
yourself, try to seek the
guidance of the Holy Spirit
and be completely honest.

have us do for the welfare of our souls. (Note that
2 Nephi 32:89 is a scripture mastery passage. You
may want to mark it in a distinctive way so you can
locate it in the future.)

Ponder what it means to pray always. As you read the
following statement by Elder David A. Bednar of the
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, underline one or more
ways we can fulfill the command to “pray always”:

“There may be things in our character, in
our behavior, or concerning our spiritual
growth about which we need to counsel
with Heavenly Father in morning prayer.
After expressing appropriate thanks for
blessings received, we plead for
understanding, direction, and help to do the things we
cannot do in our own strength alone... .

“During the course of the day, we keep a prayer in our
heart for continued assistance and guidance... .

“We notice during this particular day that there are
occasions where normally we would have a tendency
to speak harshly, and we do not; or we might be
inclined to anger, but we are not. We discern heavenly
help and strength and humbly recognize answers to

our prayer. Even in that moment of recognition, we
offer a silent prayer of gratitude.

“At the end of our day, we kneel again and report
back to our Father. We review the events of the day
and express heartfelt thanks for the blessings and the
help we received. We repent and, with the assistance
of the Spirit of the Lord, identify ways we can do and
become better tomorrow. Thus our evening prayer
builds upon and is a continuation of our morning
prayer. And our evening prayer also is a preparation
for meaningful morning prayer.

“Morning and evening prayers—and all of the prayers
in between—are not unrelated, discrete events; rather,
they are linked together each day and across days,
weeks, months, and even years. This is in part how we
fulfill the scriptural admonition to ‘pray always’ (Luke
21:36; 3 Nephi 18:15, 18; D&C 31:12). Such meaningful
prayers are instrumental in obtaining the highest
blessings God holds in store for His faithful children”
(“Pray Always,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2008, 41-42).

6. Write in your scripture study journal how you think
following Elder Bednar’s instructions on how to “pray
always” could help you in your life.

83
To conclude this lesson, read the following testimony
from Elder Spencer J. Condie, who was then serving as
a member of the Seventy, concerning feasting on the
words of Christ: “You may be facing decisions regarding
a mission, your future career, and, eventually, marriage.
As you read the scriptures and pray for direction, you
may not actually see the answer in the form of printed
words on the page, but as you read you will receive
distinct impressions, and promptings, and, as promised,
the Holy Ghost ‘will show unto you all things what ye
should do’ [2 Nephi 32:5]” (“Becoming a Great Benefit
to Our Fellow Beings,” Ensign, May 2002, 45).

2 Nephi 33

Introduction

Nephi concluded his record by declaring that his written
words testify of Jesus Christ and persuade people to do
good and endure to the end. He said that although he
wrote “in weakness,” his message was “of great worth”
and his words would “be made strong” for those who
would read them (see 2 Nephi 33:3—-4). He testified that
his writings were “the words of Christ” and that people
would be accountable to God for their response to them
(see 2 Nephi 33:10-15).

1. Inthe previous lesson, you were invited to try to
“pray always” for 24 hours. In your scripture study
journal, write your thoughts and feelings about your experience.

2 Nephi 33:1-15
Nephi explains his purposes for writing
Think for a moment of reasons why you may want the

Holy Ghost to bring a message into your heart.

What is the difference between a message going unto
someone’s heart and a message going into someone’s

heart?
Unto (re)

Read 2 Nephi 33:1, and look for which word—unto or
into—Nephi used to describe where the Holy Ghost
carries messages to us. You may want to mark what
you find.
Why do you think it is significant that the Holy Ghost
carries the truth unto our hearts but not into our
hearts?

Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles made the following statement about 2 Nephi
33:1: “Please notice how the power of the Spirit carries
the message unto but not necessarily into the heart.A
teacher can explain, demonstrate, persuade, and testify,
and do so with great spiritual power and effectiveness.
Ultimately, however, the content of a message and the
witness of the Holy Ghost penetrate into the heart only
if a receiver allows them to enter. Learning by faith
opens the pathway into the heart” (“Seek Learning by
Faith,” Ensign, Sept. 2007, 61).

Elder Gerald N. Lund, who was then
serving as a member of the Seventy,
explained why the Holy Ghost will carry
the word unto, but not into, our hearts:
“Why just unto the heart? Individual
agency is so sacred that Heavenly Father
will never force the human heart, even with all His
infinite power. Man may try to do so, but God does
not. To put it another way, God allows us to be the
guardians, or the gatekeepers, of our own hearts. We
must, of our own free will, open our hearts to the
Spirit, for He will not force Himself upon us”
(“Opening Our Hearts,” Ensign or Liahona, May
2008, 33).

What do you think people need to do to open their
hearts to the Spirit?

Read 2 Nephi 33:2, and identify what happens when
people choose to harden their hearts. It may be helpful
to know that the phrase “things of naught” means
“worthless.”

2. Write in your scripture study journal what behaviors

and attitudes you think someone with an open heart
would demonstrate during personal scripture study, during
home-study seminary, and during sacrament meeting.

In 2 Nephi 33:1-2 we are taught this principle: When
we open our hearts, messages from the Holy Ghost
can enter our hearts. You may want to write this
principle in your scriptures.

3. Write in your scripture study journal answers to the
following questions:

a. When have you felt that a gospel message has entered your
heart? What were the circumstances, and what were the results?

b. What does this tell you about your heart at that time?

Read 2 Nephi 33:3-7, looking for Nephi’s hopes for
those who would read his words. Then complete the
following sentences, using your own words or the
words of Nephi. Be aware that a few of the phrases
might have more than one answer:

2 Nephi 33:3—I pray continually for

2 Nephi 33:4—I know

2 Nephi 33:6—I glory

2 Nephi 33:7—I have

As you finish studying 2 Nephi 33, keep in mind that
these verses are Nephi’s final testimony recorded in
scripture. Read 2 Nephi 33:10-14, and imagine you are
hearing these words from Nephi himself. You might
underline phrases that are meaningful to you.

4. Write in your scripture study journal some of the

phrases from 2 Nephi 33:10—-14 that were meaningful to
you, and explain why. Also answer the following question in your
scripture study journal: If people believe in Christ, how will they
feel about the Book of Mormon? (See 2 Nephi 33:10.)

Read 2 Nephi 33:15, and ponder Nephi’s final words:
“T must obey.” You may want to write “1 Nephi 3:7”
as a cross-reference in your scriptures next to 2 Nephi
33:15. Review 1 Nephi 3:7, and identify how these two
verses are related.

5. Spend a few

who might reject his words add to our accountability
for how we treat the Book of Mormon. President Joseph
Fielding Smith taught that, as members of the Church,
we have a responsibility to study the Book of Mormon:

85
“Tt seems to me that any member of this Church
would never be satisfied until he or she had read the
Book of Mormon time and time again, and thoroughly
considered it so that he or she could bear witness that
it is in very deed a record with the inspiration of the
Almighty upon it, and that its history is true... .

“... No member of this Church can stand approved
in the presence of God who has not seriously and
carefully read the Book of Mormon” (in Conference
Report, Oct. 1961, 18).

You have the opportunity to decide how you will treat

Nephi’s words and the Book of Mormon.

INTRODUCTION TO

Jacob

Why Study This Book?

By studying the book of Jacob, you can learn
important lessons from a man who had unshakable
faith in Jesus Christ. Jacob repeatedly testified of the
Savior and invited his people and those who would
read his words to repent. He taught and demonstrated
the importance of diligently fulfilling callings from
the Lord. He warned his people against the dangers
of pride, riches, and immorality. Jacob also quoted
and commented on Zenos's allegory of the olive
trees, which illustrates the Savior’s tireless efforts

to bring about the salvation of all Goa’s children.

In his encounter with Sherem, an anti-Christ, Jacob
demonstrated how to righteously respond to those
who question or criticize our faith.

Who Wrote This Book?

Jacob, the fifth son of Sariah and Lehi, wrote this
book. He was born in the wilderness during his
family’s journey to the promised land. In his youth,
Jacob “suffered afflictions and much sorrow,
because of the rudeness of [his] brethren” (2 Nephi
2:1). However, Lehi promised him that God would
“consecrate [Jacob's] afflictions for [his] gain” and
that he would spend his days “in the service of [his]
God” (2 Nephi 2:2-3). In his youth, Jacob beheld the
Savior’s glory (see 2 Nephi 2:3-4). Nephi consecrated
Jacob to be a priest and teacher of the Nephites
(see 2 Nephi 5:26) and later entrusted him with

the small plates of Nephi (see Jacob 1:1-4). As a
faithful priesthood leader and teacher, Jacob labored
diligently to persuade his people to believe in Christ
(see Jacob 1:7). He received revelations concerning
the Savior, experienced the ministering of angels
and heard the voice of the Lord (see Jacob 7:5), and
saw his Redeemer (see 2 Nephi 11:2-3). Jacob was
the father of Enos, to whom he entrusted the plates
before his death.

When and Where Was It Written?

The book of Jacob begins in approximately 544 B.c.,
when Nephi entrusted Jacob with the small plates.
It concludes near the end of Jacob's life, when he
passed the plates to his son, Enos. Jacob wrote this
record while living in the land of Nephi.

UNIT 9: DAY 3|
Jacob 1-2

Introduction

After Nephi’s death, the Nephites began to “indulge
themselves somewhat in wicked practices” under
the reign of a new king (Jacob 1:15). Nephi’s two
younger brothers, Jacob and Joseph, had been
consecrated by Nephi as priests and teachers of the
people, and they diligently labored to persuade the
people to repent and come unto Christ. Jacob obeyed
Nephi’s commandment to record sacred teachings,
revelations, and prophecies on the small plates. True
to his divinely given responsibility, Jacob called his
people to repentance, warning them of the sins of
pride, the love of riches, and sexual immorality. He
taught about the dangers and consequences of these
three prevalent sins.

Jacob 1:1-2:11
Jacob warns the people of their wickedness

Consider what you would say in the following
situation: One of your friends at Church expresses a
negative attitude toward his or her priesthood leaders
and says, “They don’t seem to be in touch with the real
world. They keep warning about choices that aren’t

a big deal. I wish they wouldn’t spend so much time
telling us all the bad things we need to avoid. They
should just talk about positive things.”

Think about why priesthood leaders sometimes warn
against sin. Jacob recorded that after Nephi’s death
(see Jacob 1:9), the people began to engage in certain
wicked practices. Read Jacob 1:15—16, and identify
what the people were doing that concerned Jacob.

87
You may want to circle the word began in Jacob 1:15-16.
Why is it a blessing to have priesthood leaders who
warn us about problems when or even before they
begin?

Read Jacob 1:68, and identify why Jacob and his
fellow leaders were counseling the people of Nephi
against sin. Why do you think priesthood leaders in
your family, as well as local and general priesthood
leaders, warn you about sin and teach you the gospel
so diligently? You may want to mark the phrases in
Jacob 1:7 that teach the following truth: Priesthood
leaders labor diligently to help us come to Christ.

Read Jacob 1:17-19, and look for any additional
reasons why Jacob and his brother Joseph were
laboring so diligently to teach the people.

What do you think it means to receive an “errand from
the Lord” (Jacob 1:17)?

You might want to mark any other phrases that help
teach the following principle: Priesthood leaders
have a divinely given responsibility to teach the
word of God and warn against sin.

Ponder for a moment about why it is important to
understand that Church leaders are held accountable
for their efforts to teach us what the Lord wants us to
know.

As you read Jacob 2:1-3, 6-7, 10-11, look for phrases
that indicate how Jacob felt about his difficult task of
calling his people to repentance.

1. Think about what the following phrases teach you

about Jacob's motivation to complete his difficult task:
"| this day am weighed down with much more desire and
anxiety for the welfare of your souls” (Jacob 2:3) and “I must
do according to the strict commands of God” (Jacob 2:10).
Write in your scripture study journal a response to the
following questions:

a. When have you felt a priesthood leader's love and concern
for you?

b. When have you felt that a priesthood leader's words or
actions were inspired by God to help you?

Reflect again upon the situation presented at the
beginning of the lesson. Think about how you would
answer your friend based on what you have studied
today.

Relating Scriptures
to Our Daily Lives

As you study the scriptures, it is
important to pause and ponder
how a particular principle can
be applied in your life. Think
about how you would act if
you understood and lived a
principle taught in the scrip-
tures. In this case, pondering
how you would answer a
friend with a negative attitude
about priesthood leaders can
help you understand why our
leaders warn us against sin.

material goods. Think of

other ways the Lord has
blessed you.

Read Jacob 2:12-13, and identify what the Nephites
were seeking. Notice that Jacob taught that “the hand
of providence” had blessed the Nephites with riches.
This phrase refers to our Father in Heaven.

2. Write in your scripture study journal why it is
important for you to remember that the Lord has given
you the blessings and abilities you have.

If we are not careful, we can allow ourselves to be lifted
up in pride after we receive the blessings we seek, like
the Nephites did. In the space provided, write what
you think it means to be “lifted up in the pride of your
hearts.”

As recorded in Jacob 2:13, what did Jacob say were
several causes of the Nephites’ pride?

Think of a modern-day person or group of people
who mistreat, ignore, or persecute others because
they “have obtained more abundantly” than those
they mistreat (Jacob 2:13). For example, because some
people have more money, more friends, more athletic
ability, or even a greater knowledge of the gospel than
someone else, they may mistakenly think they are
better than others or even persecute them. Ponder if
there has been a time in your life when you have acted
in a prideful manner.
Read Jacob 2:17-21, and mark phrases that could help
you overcome pride.

3. In your scripture study journal, write two or more of

the phrases that you found in Jacob 2:17-21, and explain
how those phrases can help you overcome pride. Some of the
following questions may be helpful to consider as you complete
this assignment: What do you think it means to seek the kingdom
of God? To obtain a hope in Christ? How would seeking the
kingdom of God and obtaining a hope in Christ influence how
you view and treat others?

Imagine that your mother, father, or leader asked you
what you studied today. Write down one principle
from Jacob 2:17-21 that you could use to answer them.

One principle in Jacob 2:17-21 is: We should seek
the kingdom of God above all other interests.

4. Write in your scripture study journal one way you can
use the blessings and opportunities the Lord has given you
to help build the kingdom of God and bless the lives of others.

Jacob 2:22-30
Jacob chastises his people for sexual immorality

The following statement was made by President Ezra
Taft Benson. Guess what two words go in the blanks:

“The plaguing sin of this generation is

” (“Cleansing the Inner Vessel,” Ensign,
May 1986, 4; look at the end of the lesson for the
correct answer).

Read Jacob 2:22-23, 28, and mark phrases Jacob used
to describe the seriousness of sexual immorality. It
may be helpful to understand that the word whoredoms
refers to sexual sins.

Elder Richard G. Scott of the Quorum
of the Twelve Apostles explained some
actions that violate the Lord’s law of
chastity: “Any sexual intimacy outside

of the bonds of marriage—I mean any
intentional contact with the sacred,
private parts of another’s body, with or without
clothing—is a sin and is forbidden by God. It is also a
transgression to intentionally stimulate these emotions
within your own body” (“Making the Right Choices,”
Ensign, Nov. 1994, 38).

Homosexual acts and viewing pornography also violate
the Lord’s law of chastity.

Notice how the Nephites sought to excuse their sins,
as recorded in Jacob 2:23-24. Take a moment to think
about how people seek to excuse sexual immorality
today.

One of the sins of the Nephites was the unauthorized
practice of plural marriage. Jacob taught the Lord’s
commandment that a man should be married to
only one wife (see Jacob 2:27). Having more than
one wife without the Lord’s authorization through
His appointed priesthood leaders is an example of a
sexual sin. In God’s eyes, sexual sins are very serious
(see Alma 39:5).

The Lord’s people are authorized to practice plural
marriage only when the Lord commands it (see Jacob
2:30). At certain times in the history of the world, the
Lord has commanded His people to practice plural
marriage. For example, plural marriage was practiced
in Old Testament times by Abraham and Sarah (see
Genesis 16:1-3; D&C 132:34—35, 37) and by their
grandson Jacob (see D&C 132:37), and it was practiced
for a time during the early days of the restored Church,
beginning with the Prophet Joseph Smith (see D&C
132:32-33, 53). However, God commanded His
prophet Wilford Woodruff to end the practice of plural
marriage (see Official Declaration 1 in the Doctrine
and Covenants).

Read Jacob 2:31-35, and mark phrases showing some
of the negative consequences of sexual sin.

5. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:
a. According to Jacob, how does sexual immorality affect
families?
b. Some youth may rationalize that they can be sexually
immoral because they are not married and, therefore, are not
unfaithful to a spouse, and they do not have children. How
might immorality affect a teenager and his or her family?

c. Why do you think the Lord considers immorality to be such
a serious sin?

Review the beginning of Jacob 2:28, and mark what the
Lord delights in. (Note that though Jacob specifically
mentioned women in this verse, it is equally true that
the Lord delights in the chastity of men.) This verse
teaches the principle: The Lord delights in chastity.

Based on what you have learned today, consider why
the Lord delights in the chastity of His children. Think
about your family, as well as the family you hope to
have in the future. How will living according to the
Lord’s law of chastity bless you and them? Ponder

89
how the choices you are making to be chaste and
clean delight the Lord.

You can remain clean. If you have already sinned
against the law of chastity, you can repent and become
clean through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Seek the
guidance of the Holy Spirit as you think of one or more
ways you can better guard yourself against breaking
the law of chastity. If you have committed any sexual
transgressions, do whatever is necessary, including
meeting with your bishop or branch president, to
confess what you have done in violation of the Lord’s
law of chastity.

assignments in your scripture study journal:

with my teacher:

Answer to the missing words in the quotation at the
beginning of this lesson: President Benson said, “The
plaguing sin of this generation is sexual immorality.”

Jacob 3-4

Introduction

Jacob 3 contains the conclusion of a sermon Jacob
delivered to his people. In this conclusion, Jacob
briefly offered words of comfort and promise to the
pure in heart. He also rebuked the proud and unchaste
among his people, warning them of the consequences
if they would not repent. Jacob 4 contains words

that Jacob was inspired to write for the people who
would someday read his record. He testified of the
Atonement of Jesus Christ and exhorted his readers to
reconcile (restore to harmony) themselves to God the
Father through the Atonement. With a warning voice,
he told of Jews who would reject Jesus Christ and the
plainness of His gospel.

Jacob 3

Jacob encourages the pure in heart, and he urges others
to repent

Think about what advice you might give to a young
man or woman in the following situations:

90

e A young woman who is striving to live righteously
suffers because her father is addicted to alcohol.

e A young man who does his best to live the gospel
struggles because of his parents’ divorce.

e A young woman diligently tries to love her family,
but she struggles at home because of the selfishness
and inconsiderate actions of her sister.

Ponder a time you experienced trials even though you
were striving to live righteously. Jacob taught us what
to do in such situations. Read the first sentence of
Jacob 3:1, and identify whom Jacob addressed first in
chapter 3.

Jacob said that because of others’ pride and immorality
(which he had previously warned against, as recorded
in Jacob 2) the pure in heart had suffered. Read Jacob
3:1-2, and fill in the following chart:

What did Jacob exhort the
pure in heart to do?

What does God promise
the pure in heart?

1. Review your answers in the first column. To help you
further consider this principle, answer two of the
following questions in your scripture study journal:

a. How do you think a young person can “look unto God with
firmness of mind”?

b. What do you think it means to pray unto God “with
exceeding faith” during a time of trial?

c. What do you think a young person can do to “receive the
pleasing word of God”?

2. Review your answers in the second column. These
verses teach that God will console the pure in heart
in their afflictions. To help you further consider this principle,
answer one or more of the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. How has God consoled you in your afflictions as you have
tried to follow Him?

b. How has praying “with exceeding faith” helped you during
a time of trial?

c. When has receiving God’s word helped you feel His love?

After speaking to the pure in heart, Jacob addressed
those who were not pure in heart. Read Jacob 3:3—-4,
10-12, and identify what Jacob urged these people to
do. It may be helpful to know that the phrase “arouse
the faculties” means to awaken our abilities and
emotions, and the words fornication and lasciviousness
refer to sexual sins and lust.

In Jacob 3:3—4, 10-12, we also read Jacob’s warnings
about what would happen if his people did not repent.
After studying these verses, circle the phrases that
describe the following consequences: (a) The Lamanites
would destroy them. (b) Their example would lead their
children to destruction. (c) They would experience the
second death, or in other words, a separation from God.

Consider for a moment how Jacob’s warning could be
considered a great blessing to his people.

As recorded in Jacob 3:5—7, Jacob boldly stated that the
Lamanites were “more righteous” than the Nephites
because “their husbands love their wives, and their
wives love their husbands; and their husbands and
their wives love their children.” The Nephites needed
to repent of all their sins, specifically those that led to
decreased love and trust in their families.

Ponder Jacob 3:11-12, and summarize the message in
your own words.

To prepare to study
Jacob 4, lift your pen or
pencil at least two feet
or one meter above your
manual, and try to drop

it so that it hits the center of the target—“the mark.”
You may want to try this several times. Think about
how less effective your efforts would be if you were
looking somewhere other than the target. How well
do you think people would do in archery if they never
looked at the target, or mark, while they were shooting
or if they looked at what was beyond the mark? Read
Jacob 4:14, and identify characteristics of the people
Jacob prophesied would look “beyond the mark.”

You may want to write in your scriptures next to Jacob
4:14 that “the mark is Christ” (Neal A. Maxwell, “Jesus
of Nazareth, Savior and King,” Ensign, May 1976, 26).
Similarly, Paul taught, “I press toward the mark for

the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus”
(Philippians 3:14).

The prophet Jacob was referring to the Jews who
misunderstood the law of Moses and its intent to lead
them to the Savior. Many of the Jews were looking
for a different kind of deliverance than the kind Jesus,
the Messiah, offered them—they were looking for
deliverance from foreign rule and oppression.

3. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:
a. What do you think it means to look beyond the mark (Jesus
Christ)?
b. What attitudes and actions listed in Jacob 4:14 blinded the
Jews and prevented them from accepting Jesus Christ?

c. What might be some examples of looking beyond the mark,
or failing to focus on the Savior, today?

Jacob wanted those who would read his record to have
an attitude completely different from the attitude of
the Jews who missed the mark. Read Jacob 4:4, and
identify what Jacob wanted all who would read his
record to know. Read also Jacob 4:12, and mark the
phrase “why not speak of the atonement of Christ.”
As recorded in Jacob 4:4-12, Jacob gave several reasons
why he believed in Jesus Christ and why he felt it was
important to let others know of the Atonement.

91
4. Write the following scripture references in your

scripture study journal, and then write brief summaries
of what Jacob taught about Jesus Christ or the Atonement in
each reference:

a. Jacob 4:4-6

b. Jacob 4:7-8

c. Jacob 4:9-10
d. Jacob 4:11

What words or phrases in Jacob 4:4-6 indicate Jacob’s
people understood the nature of the Godhead?

It may be helpful to know that being “presented as the
first-fruits of Christ unto God” (Jacob 4:11) refers to
standing before God worthy of entering the celestial
kingdom. Also, it is important to understand that if we
are to have “a hope of [the Savior’s] glory” (Jacob 4:4),
we must believe that Jesus Christ has provided the way
for us to be redeemed from our sins and be resurrected
so we can return to the presence of Heavenly Father.

One truth we can learn in Jacob 4 is this: Through the
Atonement of Jesus Christ, we can be filled with
hope and reconcile ourselves with God.

5. Write short answers to the following in your scripture
study journal:

Jacob 5-6

Introduction

Jacob 5 contains the allegory of the tame and wild olive
trees, which was originally given by a prophet named
Zenos. Jacob used this allegory to teach that the Lord
is always working to bring salvation to His covenant
people, even when they turn away from Him. The
allegory shows that the Lord scattered portions of the
house of Israel—His covenant people—throughout
the earth and that He will gather His people in the

Saat

for food, and olive oil was used for cooking, medicine, and fuel for lamps. However, olive trees required much care and labor to help them

produce good fruit.

latter days. The allegory has specific and personal
application to us today as members of the house
of Israel and servants of the Lord. In Jacob 6, Jacob
emphasized the Lord’s mercy and justice while
encouraging his people—and us—to repent.

Jacob 5:1-12

Jacob quotes Zenos, who likened the house of Israel to
a tame olive tree

Do you know of a friend or loved one who has
questioned God’s love for him or her, particularly
during a time of trial when the person may have
turned away from Him? Consider the following
examples:

e A young priesthood holder develops a sinful habit.
He believes that others can be forgiven, but he
doubts the Lord will accept his repentance.

e Ayoung woman transgresses a commandment. She

experiences guilt, feels terrible about herself, and
questions if the Lord still loves her.

Jacob prophesied that the Jews would reject Jesus
Christ (see Jacob 4:15). He also prophesied that Jesus
Christ would continue to labor for the salvation

of His people even after they had rejected Him. To
illustrate this truth, Jacob quoted an allegory given by
a prophet named Zenos (see Jacob 5:1). An allegory,
like a parable, is a story that uses symbolic characters,
objects, and actions to teach truths. As you study
Jacob 5, consider how the Lord is always reaching out
to you even when you have sinned.

Read Jacob 5:2, and mark in your scriptures whom
Zenos directed this teaching to.

Because you have made covenants with the Lord
through baptism, you are a member of the house of
Israel. You are part of the story told in Jacob 5. Read
Jacob 5:3, and mark what Zenos used in his allegory to
represent the house of Israel. Also mark what began to
happen to the tame olive tree.

Notice that footnote d in Jacob 5:3 indicates that the
decay of the tree represents apostasy. Apostasy occurs
when individuals or groups of people turn away from
the Lord and His gospel.

The following chart lists symbols that help us
understand the meaning of Zenos’s allegory. Also
listed are the verses where these symbols first appear.
Mark these symbols in your scriptures. You may also
want to write the meaning of some of the symbols in
the margins of your scriptures.

Read Jacob 5:4—6, and mark what the Master of the
vineyard did first to save the tame olive tree. Look

at the chart above, and notice who the Master of the
vineyard is and what His actions of pruning, digging,
and nourishing represent.

In the process of grafting, healthy living branches are cut from a tree

and inserted into the trunk of another tree to grow.

Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum
of the Twelve Apostles explained what
the allegory is intended to be about. As
you read his explanation, underline what
he teaches is the deeper meaning of this

allegory.
“This allegory as recounted by Jacob is from the

outset intended to be about Christ [the Master of the
vineyard]... .

“Even as the Lord of the vineyard and his workers
strive to bolster, prune, purify, and otherwise

make productive their trees in what amounts to

a one-chapter historical sketch of the scattering
and gathering of Israel, the deeper meaning of the
Atonement undergirds and overarches their labors”
(Christ and the New Covenant: The Messianic Message
of the Book of Mormon [1997], 165).

While Jacob 5 appears to be about olive trees, this
allegory is about people who have turned away from
the Lord in sin and the Lord’s efforts to help them
return to Him. This chapter teaches that the Lord
loves us and labors diligently for our salvation.
As you continue to study the allegory, look for
evidence of this truth by paying close attention to the
Lord’s feelings for Israel—the tame olive tree—and His
tireless efforts to save it. For example, read Jacob 5:7,
and ponder the phrase “It grieveth me that I should
lose this tree.” What emotions do you think the Lord
expressed here, and why?

Read the phrase again, and this time insert your name
in place of “this tree”: “It grieveth me that I should
lose [your name].” By inserting your name throughout

94

Jacob 5 in places that are meaningful and appropriate,
you will be able to relate the allegory to yourself and
learn more about the Lord’s concern for you.

1. Using the meaning

of the symbols on the
chart, write an explanation in
your scripture study journal of
what the Lord of the vineyard
and His servant do in Jacob
5:7-11 to try and save
Heavenly Father's children.

You may also insert the word
for mein suitable places in
the scriptures. This practice can
help you engage in meaningful
scripture study and see how
certain passages may relate

to you.

The Lord takes people

who are not of the house of Israel and grafts them into
Israel, making them part of His covenant people. To
save the house of Israel, He plucks off the most wicked
branches (people) and destroys them.

Read Jacob 5:13-14, and look for what the Lord did
with the young and tender branches from the tame
olive tree mentioned in verse 6. You may want to write
in your margin that nethermost means lowest or least
visible.

2. Using the meanings of the symbols on the chart,

explain in your scripture study journal how the family of
Lehi could be compared to a young and tender branch that was
hid in the nethermost part of the vineyard.

President Joseph Fielding Smith explained that the
Lord’s servants “took some of the branches and grafted
them in to all the wild olive trees. Who were the wild
olive trees? The Gentiles. And so the Lord sent his
servants to all parts of his vineyard, which is the world,
and planted these branches of the tree... .

“Now in that parable the olive tree is the
House of Israel. . . . In its native land it
began to die. So the Lord took branches
like the Nephites, like the lost tribes, and
like others that the Lord led off that we do
not know anything about, to other parts of
the earth. He planted them all over his vineyard, which
is the world. No doubt he sent some of these branches
into Japan, into Korea, into China. No question about it,
because he sent them to all parts of the world” (Answers
to Gospel Questions, comp. Joseph Fielding Smith Jr.,

5 vols. [1957-66], 4:204—5).

President Smith also taught that “the interpretation
of this parable . . . is a story of the scattering of Israel
and the mixing of the blood of Israel with the wild
olive trees, or Gentile peoples, in all parts of the world.
Therefore we find in China, Japan, India, and in all
other countries that are inhabited by the Gentiles that
the blood of Israel was scattered, or ‘grafted,’ among
them” (Answers to Gospel Questions, 4:40—41).

Jacob 5:15-77

The Lord of the vineyard and his servants labor to help
the vineyard produce good fruit

Many of the verses in Jacob 5 describe different time
periods and events about various parts of the house
of Israel being scattered throughout the world and the
Savior’s work to gather them. The chapter ends with
the Millennium and the earth’s final cleansing.

To emphasize the Lord’s concern for the trees of

His vineyard and His continual efforts to save them,
Zenos repeated a few important phrases throughout
his allegory. Read Jacob 5:20, 23-25, 28, 31, and mark
each time the Lord mentioned His efforts to nourish
the trees of His vineyard.

In spite of the efforts of the Lord and His servant to
help the vineyard produce good fruit, eventually all
the fruit of the vineyard became corrupt (see Jacob
5:39). Read Jacob 5:41—42, 46-47, and mark phrases
in your scriptures that show the Lord’s love, concern,
or sorrow for His vineyard.

Because the trees were producing bad fruit despite

all He had done, the Lord of the vineyard considered
cutting down all of the trees (see Jacob 5:49). Read
Jacob 5:50-51.The rest of Jacob 5 represents the Lord’s
and His servants’ efforts to save those who live in the
last days. He gathers his people and nourishes them
one last time (see Jacob 5:52-77).

President Joseph Fielding Smith taught that the
gathering of Israel described in Jacob 5 is occurring
now: “In this day of gathering the Lord is fulfilling his
purposes and is calling back into the fold of the True
Shepherd, the children of Abraham” (Answers to Gospel
Questions, 4:41).

3. Write in your scripture study journal what you have

learned from Jacob 5 about the Lord’s love for you.
Record an example of how you have seen His love manifested
in your life or in the life of someone you know.

Jacob 6

Jacob teaches of God's mercy and justice and invites us
to repent

Jacob 6 contains Jacob’s summary of important truths

from the allegory of the olive trees. Read Jacob 6:4-6,
and look for what Jacob emphasized about God’s

character. What word would you use to summarize
what Jacob wanted us to learn about God?

Jacob concluded his message in Jacob 6:7-13 by testifying
that we are wise to prepare now for judgment by
repenting and receiving the Lord’s mercy.

4. Review Jacob 6:5. Notice that Jacob encouraged us

to “cleave unto God as he cleaveth unto you.” To cleave
means to cling or hold on to. Answer the following questions in
your scripture study journal:

a. What did you learn from the allegory of the olive trees that
illustrates how God cleaves or holds on to you?

b. What can you do to cleave more firmly unto Him as He
cleaves unto you?

Jacob 7

Introduction

Jacob relied on his testimony and the Lord to
overcome the false ideas and arguments of Sherem, an
anti-Christ. An anti-Christ is someone who vigorously
or intensely opposes Christ and tries to destroy other
people’s faith in Him, His true Church, His gospel, or
the plan of salvation.

To thwart Sherem’s efforts, Jacob drew strength from
past experiences that had increased his faith in Jesus
Christ. He also relied on the guidance of the Holy
Spirit, his knowledge of the scriptures and the words
of the prophets, and his testimony of Jesus Christ.
When Sherem demanded a sign that would prove
Jacob’s words were true, he was smitten by God. Jacob
concluded his record by describing how the Nephites
trusted in the Lord as they fortified themselves against
the Lamanites. Before Jacob died, he entrusted the
small plates to his son Enos.

95
Jacob 7:1-14

Jacob relies on the Lord as he faces Sherem, an anti-Christ

Elder Robert D. Hales of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles taught: “One of mortality’s great tests comes
when our beliefs are questioned or criticized. In such
moments, we may want to respond aggressively... .
But these are important opportunities to step back,
pray, and follow the Savior’s example. Remember that
Jesus Himself was despised and rejected by the world.
...When we respond to our accusers as the Savior did,
we not only become more Christlike, we invite others
to feel His love and follow Him as well” (“Christian
Courage: The Price of Discipleship,” Ensign or Liahona,
Nov. 2008, 72).

Think of a time when your beliefs were questioned

or criticized. As you study Jacob 7 you will learn how
Jacob experienced criticism of his faith from a man
named Sherem and how he successfully responded to
this challenge.

Read Jacob 7:1-5, and look for words and phrases that
indicate (1) what Sherem was trying to do and (2) how
he sought to accomplish his goals. You may want to
mark these in your scriptures.

According to Jacob 7:3, what effect did Sherem have on
the people?

1. Notice in Jacob 7:4 that Sherem “was learned” and

had “much power of speech.” Write in your scripture
study journal why it is sometimes difficult to defend your faith
against a person like Sherem.

Remember that not all people who question or
criticize our faith necessarily have the same motives as
Sherem. While some people, like Sherem, deliberately
seek to destroy faith, others may question our faith

96

because they are curious, or perhaps they have been
misinformed concerning our beliefs.

As you read Jacob 7:5-14, ponder how you would
respond to a person like Sherem. As you study Jacob’s
response, you will see that as we rely on the Lord we
can overcome challenges to our faith. You may want
to write this principle in the margin of your scriptures
near these verses. Look for ways Jacob demonstrated
this principle in his encounter with Sherem.

In the chart below, read the verse or verses from Jacob
7:5-14 in the first column and match that reference to
the statement in the second column that best describes
how Jacob relied on the Lord in that reference. Write
the letter of the statement on the line next to the
scripture reference.

What Jacob Did to Rely on the Lord

1. Jacob 7:5 a. He testified of the
2. Jacob 7:8 scriptures and words of
3, Jacob 7:10-11 ' ee

. He left the outcome in
4, __lacob 7:12 God's hands.
5. Jacob 7:13-14

fa)

. He relied on guidance
and strength from the
Holy Ghost.

d. He remembered past
experiences that had
strengthened his faith.

e. He shared the testimony
he had received through
the Holy Ghost.

You can check your answers to this matching activity
by referring to the correct responses found at the end
of this lesson.

How can you strengthen your testimony so that it will
not be shaken when what you believe is questioned or
criticized? Notice in Jacob 7:5 that Jacob demonstrated
the following truth: We cannot be shaken in our
faith if our testimonies are based on revelation
and true spiritual experiences. Ponder the strength
of your testimony of Jesus Christ and what you can do
to strengthen it.

Jacob’s response to Sherem provides an example for us
to follow as we respond to individuals who question or
criticize our faith.

2. Answer three of the questions below in your scripture

study journal to help you think about the things Jacob did
to rely on the Lord and how these same actions have helped or
can help you when others challenge your faith:
a. Notice in Jacob 7:5 that because of Jacob’s previous spiritual
experiences his faith became unshakable. What are some
experiences that have strengthened your faith? How can
remembering or recording these experiences help you when
someone questions or criticizes your faith?

b. In Jacob 7:8, Jacob stated that “the Lord God poured in his
Spirit into my soul.” What do you need to do to be able to have
the Spirit poured into your soul? How has the Holy Ghost helped
you as you have dealt with questions or criticisms about your
faith?

c. How can a daily habit of studying the scriptures and the
words of latter-day prophets help you in circumstances when
others question or criticize your faith? (see Jacob 7:10-11).

d. When have you shared your testimony with someone who
has questioned or criticized your faith? (see Jacob 7:12). What
was the result?

e. Rather than seeking to prove the truthfulness of his
testimony when Sherem sought for a sign, Jacob left the
outcome in the Lord's hands (see Jacob 7:14). How can it help
you to know that you don’t need to prove the truthfulness of
your testimony to those who challenge your faith?

Jacob 7:15-23

Sherem is smitten, confesses, and dies, leading the Nephite
multitude to turn to the Lord

Elder Robert D. Hales taught:

“When we do not retaliate—when we
turn the other cheek and resist feelings of
anger—we .. . stand with the Savior. We
show forth His love, which is the only
power that can subdue the adversary and
answer our accusers without accusing
them in return. That is not weakness. That is Christian
courage.

“Through the years we learn that challenges to our
faith are not new, and they aren’t likely to disappear
soon. But true disciples of Christ see opportunity in the
midst of opposition. . . .

“... Fortunately, the Lord knows the hearts of our
accusers and how we can most effectively respond to
them. As true disciples seek guidance from the Spirit, they
receive inspiration tailored to each encounter. And in every
encounter, true disciples respond in ways that invite the
Spirit of the Lord” (“Christian Courage: The Price of
Discipleship,” 72-73).

What do you think it means to “see opportunity in the
midst of opposition”?

Good can result as we respond to those who challenge
our faith in ways that invite the Spirit of the Lord. Read

Jacob 7:15-23, and look for the good that resulted from
Jacob’s encounter with Sherem.

What evidence do you see in Jacob 7:21-22 that Jacob
desired his experience with Sherem to help others?

According to Jacob 7:23, how did Jacob’s encounter
with Sherem ultimately affect the multitude?

3. One principle we learn from Jacob's encounter with
Sherem is that as we respond to questions or criticisms
of our faith in ways that invite the Spirit, we can help others
turn to the Lord. Write answers to the following questions about
this principle in your scripture study journal:
a. How can knowing this principle allow you to help others turn
to the Lord?

b. How might you seek to apply this principle?

Jacob 7:24-27

Jacob describes Nephite dealings with the Lamanites and
concludes his record

Read Jacob 7:24—27. Highlight a phrase in Jacob 7:25
that reinforces Jacob’s message about the importance
of relying on the Lord as we face challenges.

4. Answer the following question in your scripture study
journal: What is one thing you will do to prepare for a
time when someone challenges your faith?

If you have concerns about how to deal with specific
questions or criticisms of your faith, study the manual
True to the Faith: A Gospel Reference, Elder Robert D.
Hales’s general conference address “Christian
Courage: The Price of Discipleship” (Ensign or Liahona,
Nov. 2008, 72-75), and other resources available on

INTRODUCTION TO

Enos

Why Study This Book?

The book of Enos illustrates the power of the
Atonement of Jesus Christ to cleanse people from sin
and make them whole. Enos wrestled before God in
mighty prayer before his sins were forgiven. He then
prayed for the spiritual welfare of the Nephites and
Lamanites. He spent the remainder of his life laboring
for their salvation. As you study the book of Enos,
you can discover important lessons about prayer,
repentance, and revelation. You can also learn that
as individuals receive the blessings of the Atonement,
they will desire to share those blessings with others.

Who Wrote This Book?

Enos, the son of Jacob and the grandson of Lehi and
Sariah, authored this book. Enos recorded that his
father taught him “in the nurture and admonition
of the Lord” (Enos 1:1). Near the end of his life, Enos
wrote that he had declared “the word according to
the truth which is in Christ” (Enos 1:26) throughout
all his days. Before his death, Enos passed the small
plates of Nephi to his son Jarom. Enos concluded his
record by rejoicing in the day when he would stand
before his Redeemer. He declared, “Then shall | see
his face with pleasure, and he will say unto me: Come
unto me, ye blessed, there is a place prepared for you
in the mansions of my Father” (Enos 1:27).

When and Where Was It Written?

Enos closed his record by declaring that 179 years had
passed since Lehi left Jerusalem (see Enos 1:25). That
places the date of his writing between approximately
544 B.c. (when Jacob closed his record) and 420 B.c. Enos
wrote this record while living in the land of Nephi.

UNIT 10: DAY 3,
Enos

Introduction

After reflecting on the words of his father, Enos prayed
for and received a remission of his sins. He then prayed
for the spiritual welfare of the Nephites and Lamanites
and spent his life laboring for their salvation.

Enos 1:1-8

After reflecting on the words of his father, Enos prays for
and receives a remission of his sins

Read Enos 1:1, 3, and notice the influence Jacob had
on Enos. Although Enos was the son and grandson of
prophets, he still needed to experience the power of
the Atonement of Jesus Christ for himself.

Think of a time when you have felt very hungry. Circle
some words below that describe what you feel when
you are hungry:

empty pain
weak anxious
unsatisfied a craving
starving

Highlight the phrase “my soul hungered” in Enos 1:4.
What do you think this phrase means?

The phrase “my soul hungered” may involve feelings
such as spiritual emptiness or pain or a desire to be
filled spiritually. Enos wrote about a time when he
experienced this spiritual hunger. He wrote that his
father’s words “sunk deep into [his] heart” (Enos 1:3).
As he reflected on those words, he experienced desires
that led him to act in faith. His faithful actions brought
changes in his life and blessings from the Lord.
1. Begin a series of exercises to help you understand

Enos’s experience and relate it to your life by dividing
a full page of your scripture study journal into six sections and
labeling each section as follows:

What Enos desired: What | desire:

What Enos did: What | need to do:

What Enos experienced: My experience:

2. Read Enos 1:2—3, and look for phrases in each verse

that indicate what Enos desired to have in his life. Write
these phrases in the section marked ”What Enos desired” in your
scripture study journal chart.

Enos’s desire for a remission of his sins helps us
understand what he meant in Enos 1:4 when he
wrote, “My soul hungered.” In addition to hungering
for forgiveness, Enos also desired “eternal life, and the
joy of the saints” (Enos 1:3). He wanted to feel the
happiness that comes from being worthy to be with
the Lord and others who are righteous.

3. Consider if you have some of the same feelings of
spiritual hunger that Enos described. In your scripture

study journal chart, in the section marked “What | desire,” write
about some of the spiritual desires that you hunger for in your life.

Enos’s desires led him to exercise his faith and act.

In Enos 1:2, identify and mark the word Enos used

to describe the effort he made. Notice that Enos did
not wrestle with God but before God in prayer. Such
wrestling involves a mental and spiritual struggle to
show Heavenly Father the sincerity of our desires and
our willingness to repent and make necessary changes
in our lives. In Enos 1:4, Enos recorded some details
describing his wrestle.

4. Read Enos 1:4, and mark the things Enos did to show

he was sincere as he sought a remission of his sins. List
what you identify under ”What Enos did” in your scripture study
journal chart.

The word supplication in Enos 1:4 means to ask humbly
and with great desire. Our prayers may not be as long
as Enos’s, but they need to be sincere.

5. In your scripture study journal chart, under ”What |

need to do,” write your thoughts about how you can
show the Lord your sincerity as you pray and seek His spiritual
blessings.

6. Enos’s faithful and sincere efforts led to great

blessings in his life. Read Enos 1:5—8, and mark what
Enos experienced. List these in the “What Enos experienced”
section of your scripture study journal chart. As you read verses
5 and 6, notice how Enos knew he had been forgiven. The voice
mentioned in verse 5 was a voice that came into Enos’s mind
(see Enos 1:10).

Enos 1:7-8 teaches that as we exercise faith in
Jesus Christ, our sins can be forgiven and we can
be made whole. Our desires to improve, our sincere
prayers, and our efforts to repent are ways we can
show faith in Jesus Christ.

President Dieter F. Uchtdorf of the First Presidency
explained how our guilt can be swept away as we
exercise faith in Jesus Christ and repent of our sins:

“Once we have truly repented, Christ will
take away the burden of guilt for our sins.
We can know for ourselves that we have
been forgiven and made clean. The Holy
Ghost will verify this to us; He is the
Sanctifier. No other testimony of
forgiveness can be greater... .

“|The Lord] declared, ‘Behold, he who has repented
of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord,
remember them no more’ (D&C 58:42).

“Satan will try to make us believe that our sins are not
forgiven because we can remember them. Satan is a liar;
he tries to blur our vision and lead us away from the path

99
of repentance and forgiveness. God did not promise
that we would not remember our sins. Remembering
will help us avoid making the same mistakes again. But
if we stay true and faithful, the memory of our sins will
be softened over time. This will be part of the needed
healing and sanctification process” Ensign or Liahona,
May 2007, 101).

To help you apply President Uchtdorf’s words, reflect
on the following questions: When have you felt that
the Lord forgave you of your sins? How did you
know you were forgiven? Have you felt the Lord’s
forgiveness recently?

7. After pondering the questions above, record in the

“My experience” section in your scripture study journal
chart your experience with the feelings of forgiveness. Or you
could write about what you hope to experience as you exercise
faith in Jesus Christ.

Enos 1:9-27

Enos prays for the Nephites and the Lamanites and labors
with others for their salvation

This diagram illustrates Enos’s prayer. He first prayed
for himself and then expanded his prayers to include
others. Read Enos 1:9-10, and mark in your scriptures
whom Enos prayed for second. Read Enos 1:11-14, and
mark whom Enos prayed for third.

8. Respond to the following question in your scripture

study journal: Based on Enos’s description of the
Lamanites’ intentions in Enos 1:14, what impresses you about his
prayer for them?

We learn from Enos’s example that as we experience
the blessings of Jesus Christ’s Atonement, we will
seek to help others receive salvation. To help you
remember this truth, you may want to write all or part
of the following statement from President Howard W.
Hunter in the margin of your scriptures:

100

“Any time we experience the blessings
of the Atonement in our lives, we cannot
help but have a concern for the welfare
of our brethren. ...

“A great indicator of one’s personal
conversion is the desire to share the
gospel with others” (The Teachings of Howard W.

Hunter, ed. Clyde J. Williams [1997], 248-49).

Read Enos 1:19-20, 26, and mark words or phrases that
show the sincerity of Enos’s desires for the Nephites
and the Lamanites after he prayed for them.

Read Enos 1:27, and look for evidence of the joy Enos
experienced for his efforts and the assurance of eternal
life he received.

9. To help you apply what you have learned in this

lesson, prayerfully decide one or more ways you can
follow Enos’s example. Choose one statement below, and
complete it in your scripture study journal:

INTRODUCTION TO

Jarom

Why Study This Book?

As you study the book of Jarom, you will see that

God keeps His promise to bless those who obey His
commandments. You will also learn about the efforts of
Nephite kings, prophets, teachers, and priests of Jarom’s
day to help the people repent and avoid destruction.

Who Wrote This Book?

Enos’s son Jarom wrote this book. Like his father—and
like his grandfather Jacob and his great-grandfather
Lehi—Jarom had the spirit of prophecy and revelation
(see Jarom 1:2). When he finished his record, he passed
the small plates of Nephi to his son Omni.

When and Where Was It Written?

The book of Jarom covers approximately 59 years, from
about 420 B.c. to 361 B.c. (see Enos 1:25; Jarom 1:13). It
was written in the land of Nephi.

INTRODUCTION TO

Omni

Why Study This Book?

Through your study of the book of Omni, you will learn
that the Lord protected the righteous Nephites and led
them to the land of Zarahemla (see Omni 1:7, 12-13).
The book of Omni also mentions other groups—the
Mulekites (or people of Zarahemla) and the Jaredites,
whom the Lord guided to the promised land.

Who Wrote This Book?

The book of Omni was written by five different men:
Omni, Amaron, Chemish, Abinadom, and Amaleki.
Omni was the son of Jarom and a great-great-grandson
of Lehi and Sariah. Omni described himself as “a wicked
man” who had “not kept . . . the commandments

of the Lord” (Omni 1:2). Amaron (son of Omni),
Chemish (brother of Amaron), and Abinadom (son of
Chemish) each added short entries. Abinadom’s son
Amaleki wrote most of the book of Omni and was the
last person to write on the small plates of Nephi. He
entrusted the plates to King Benjamin.

When and Where Was It Written?

The various authors of the book of Omni wrote
sometime between 361 B.c. and 130 B.c. The first four
authors wrote in the land of Nephi. Amaleki made his
record in the land of Zarahemla.

Jarom and Omni

Introduction

The books of Jarom and Omni contain the final
writings from the small plates of Nephi. Jarom
received the plates from his father, Enos, and recorded
the Nephites’ struggles and blessings over a period of
approximately 60 years. He then passed the plates to
his son Omni.The book of Omni contains the writings
of five different Nephite record keepers and covers
approximately 230 years.

Jarom 1:1-15; Omni 1:5-7

Jarom describes how the Nephites prosper when they keep
the commandments of the Lord

To prepare to study an important principle taught in
Jarom and Omni, read the following experience shared
by President Dieter F. Uchtdorf of the First Presidency:

“T remember when I| was preparing to be trained as a
fighter pilot. We spent a great deal of our preliminary
military training in physical exercise. I’m still not
exactly sure why endless running was considered
such an essential preparatory part of becoming a pilot.
Nevertheless, we ran and we ran and we ran some
more.

“As | was running | began to notice something that,
frankly, troubled me. Time and again I was being
passed by men who smoked, drank, and did all
manner of things that were contrary to the gospel
and, in particular, to the Word of Wisdom.

“T remember thinking, ‘Wait a minute! Aren’t I
supposed to be able to run and not be weary?’ But I
was weary, and I was overtaken by people who were
definitely not following the Word of Wisdom. I confess,
it troubled me at the time. I asked myself, was the
promise true or was it not?” (“Continue in Patience,”
Ensign or Liahona, May 2010, 58).

Have you ever wondered if or how the Lord would
fulfill His promise to bless you for keeping His
commandments?

The prophet Jarom, who was the son of Enos,
explained how a specific promise of the Lord to his
fathers was verified, or proven to be true. Read Jarom
1:9, and mark the promise that the Lord verified to
the people.

101
1. Jarom showed that as we obey the commandments

of God, we will prosper. To see examples of this truth,
study each of the scripture references below, and answer the
accompanying questions in your scripture study journal:

a. Jarom 1:4—5, 8. What are some examples of how the
Nephites were obedient and how they were blessed?

b. Jarom 1:7, 10-12. What role did prophets and other leaders
play in helping the Nephites be obedient and prosper?

c. Omni 1:5-7. How was God's promise later verified in a
different way?

Read what President Uchtdorf taught
and testified about his experience of
wondering if the Lord would verify the
promise given in the Word of Wisdom:
“The answer didn’t come immediately.
But eventually I learned that God’s
promises are not always fulfilled as quickly as or in
the way we might hope; they come according to His
timing and in His ways. Years later I could see clear
evidence of the temporal blessings that come to those
who obey the Word of Wisdom—in addition to the
spiritual blessings that come immediately from
obedience to any of God's laws. Looking back, I know
for sure that the promises of the Lord, if perhaps not
always swift, are always certain” (“Continue in
Patience,” 58, italics added).

2. In your scripture study journal, describe an experience

when the Lord has blessed or prospered you for keeping
His commandments. From your experience, what are you able to
testify about the Lord and His promises?

Omni 1:1-30
Record keepers recount Nephite history

The descendants of Jarom wrote the book of Omni,
which covers approximately 230 years. Mark the
names of the different men who kept the small plates
after Jarom. You can find these in Omni 1:1, 4, 9, 10,
12, and 25.

The book of Omni describes several important events
in Book of Mormon history. You may remember that
in Nephi’s time the Nephites left the Lamanites and
settled in a place they called the land of Nephi. This
migration is represented on the map by the arrow
from the land of first inheritance to the land of Nephi.

Read Omni 1:12-13, and identify how the Nephites
came to live in the land of Zarahemla. You may want to
underline any phrases in these verses that indicate the
Nephites traveled by the Lord’s direction and power.
On the map, the arrow from the land of Nephi to the
land of Zarahemla represents this migration.

102

Read Omni 1:14-19, and look for similarities and
differences between the Nephites and the people they
discovered in the land of Zarahemla.

3. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. How did the lack of scriptures affect the people of
Zarahemla?

b. How might knowing this help you feel more grateful for
the scriptures and be more diligent in studying them?

The book of Omni also introduces two other groups

of people that you will study later in the Book of
Mormon. To identify one of these groups, read Omni
1:20-22, and write the word Jaredites in your scriptures
next to these verses. Coriantumr was one of the final
two survivors of the Jaredite nation; the other was the
prophet Ether. You will learn about the Jaredites in your
study of the book of Ether.
To learn about the final group of people mentioned in
Omni, note the arrow on the map that extends from
the land of Zarahemla nearly to the land of Nephi and
then back to Zarahemla and the arrow from the land
of Zarahemla that extends all the way to the land of
Nephi. These arrows represent the migrations of the
people of Zeniff, who are referred to in Omni 1:27-30.
(You may want to write “people of Zeniff” next to these
verses.) You will learn about this group of people as you
study the book of Mosiah.

The Book of Mormon does not claim to be a record of
all of the peoples who have inhabited the Americas.
Besides the Jaredites, the people of Zarahemla, and the
descendants of Lehi, there were others who came to
the American continent as well. President Anthony W.
Ivins of the First Presidency stated at the April 1929
general conference: “The Book of Mormon. . . does
not tell us that there was no one here before [the Book
of Mormon peoples]. It does not tell us that people did
not come after” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1929, 15).

Notice in Omni 1:23-24 that the final portion of this
book was written by Amaleki. He lived during the time
of King Benjamin, following the Nephites’ migration to
the land of Zarahemla. Read Omni 1:25—26, and mark
an invitation that Amaleki extends three times.

Notice that each of the
three invitations to come

1:25-26 is followed by

INTRODUCTION TO

The Words of
Mormon

Why Study This Book?

Through a study of Words of Mormon, you can
increase your faith that “the Lord knoweth all things”
(Words of Mormon 1:7) and that He guides His servants
to bring about His purposes. As a historical account,
the book serves as a bridge between the small plates
of Nephi (1 Nephi-Omni) and Mormon’s abridgment
of the large plates of Nephi (Mosiah—4 Nephi). Words
of Mormon can help you better understand which
records Mormon abridged as he compiled the Book
of Mormon. It also introduces you to the faith and
accomplishments of King Benjamin.

Who Wrote This Book?

Mormon wrote this book. He was a prophet, a record
keeper, and the abridger and compiler of most of the
Book of Mormon. The Book of Mormon is named after
him. He was also a Nephite general and a righteous
father. The prophet Moroni was his son.

When and Where Was It Written?

Mormon wrote this book about A.D. 385, after having
“witnessed almost all the destruction of [his] people,
the Nephites” (Words of Mormon 1:1). Mormon did
not record where he was when he wrote this book.

104

INTRODUCTION TO

Mosiah

Why Study This Book?

In your study of the book of Mosiah, you will read
powerful testimonies of the mission of Jesus Christ.
You also will learn about people whom the Lord
delivered from the bondage of sin or from physical
oppression. Furthermore, you will learn how the
righteous efforts of individuals such as King Benjamin,
Abinadi, and Alma brought tremendous blessings to
others. Conversely, you will see how the poor choices
of individuals such as Zeniff and his son, King Noah,
brought negative consequences upon themselves and
their people.

Who Wrote This Book?

Mormon compiled and abridged the records of several
other writers to create the book of Mosiah. The book
is named for Mosiah, who was a son of King Benjamin.
Mosiah was a prophet, seer, revelator, and king who
ruled in Zarahemla from approximately 124 to 91 B.c.
He was named after his grandfather Mosiah, who was
also a king of Zarahemla (see Omni 1:12-13, 19).

Mormon drew from a number of records to compose
the book of Mosiah. He abridged and quoted from the
record kept by Mosiah on the large plates of Nephi,
which detailed the history of the Nephites in the land
of Zarahemla (see Mosiah 1-7; 25-29). He also drew
from the record of Zeniff, which recounts the history
of Zeniff’s people from the time they left Zarahemla
until they returned (see Mosiah 7-22). Additionally,
Mormon quoted from and abridged portions of the
writings of Alma, who preserved the words of Abinadi
(see Mosiah 17:4) and kept a record of his own people
(see Mosiah 18; 23-24).

When and Where Was It Written?

The original records used as sources for the book of
Mosiah were likely written between 200 B.c. and 91 B.C.
Mormon abridged these records sometime between
A.D. 345 and 385. Mormon did not record where he
was when he compiled this book.
Words of
Mormon—Mosiah 2

Introduction

The Words of Mormon serves as a bridge between the
small plates of Nephi and Mormon’s abridgement of
the large plates of Nephi. Written almost 400 years
after the birth of Jesus Christ, this book contains a
short explanation of what the small plates of Nephi are
and why Mormon felt they needed to be included with
the other sacred writings. The Words of Mormon also
provides valuable insight into why King Benjamin had
such great influence with his people.

The small plates of Nephi were mainly devoted to the
spiritual matters and the ministry and teachings of the
prophets. The large plates of Nephi contained mostly
a secular history of the people written by the kings,
starting with Nephi. (See 1 Nephi 9:2-4.) From the
time of Mosiah, however, the large plates also included
items of major spiritual importance.

The plates of Mormon, or the gold plates delivered

to Joseph Smith, contained an abridgment by
Mormon from the large plates of Nephi, with many
commentaries. These gold plates also contained a
continuation of the history by Mormon and additions
by his son Moroni.

Small Plates

Large Plates

Mosiah 1 is a record of King Benjamin’s teachings

to his sons. He taught them that the scriptures help
us remember God and keep His commandments.

As King Benjamin approached the end of his life, he
desired to speak to his people about his service as
king and to encourage them to be obedient to God.
King Benjamin’s speech is recorded in Mosiah 2-5
and describes Christ’s suffering and Atonement,

the role of justice and mercy, and the need to take
upon ourselves the name of Christ by covenant. At
the beginning of his speech, recorded in Mosiah 2,
King Benjamin emphasized the need to serve God by
serving others and the happy state of those who keep
the commandments.

Words of Mormon 1:1-11

Mormon teaches that God has preserved various records
for a wise purpose

Think about a time when you felt prompted by the
Spirit to do something. Did you know how everything
would turn out if you followed this prompting? What
gave you the determination and confidence to act on
the prompting?

The prophet Mormon was commanded by God to
abridge the records of his people, which had been
kept on the plates of Nephi. In about A.D. 385, as he
was about to deliver his abridged records to his son,
Moroni, he followed a prompting even though he did
not know the outcome.

Mormon found something as he was searching among
the records. Read Words of Mormon 1:3 to discover
what he found. (“These plates” refers to the small
plates of Nephi, which contained 1 Nephi through
Omni.) Read Words of Mormon 1:4-6, and consider
marking in your scriptures why Mormon was pleased
when he discovered what was on these small plates.

Read Words of Mormon 1:7, and identify why Mormon
included these small plates with his abridgment of the
plates of Nephi. You may wish to mark this principle

105
in your scriptures: “The Lord knoweth all things.”
By understanding and believing this truth, you can
develop faith to obey the promptings from the Holy
Ghost that you receive.

The Lord had commanded Nephi to make the small
plates and write the sacred things of his people on
them (see 1 Nephi 9:3). At that time, Nephi declared,
“The Lord hath commanded me to make these plates
for a wise purpose in him, which purpose I know not”
(1 Nephi 9:5).

This purpose was made clear centuries later, in 1828,
when the Prophet Joseph Smith began translating the
gold plates. He first translated 116 pages of manuscript
from Mormon’s abridgment of the large plates of
Nephi, and then these pages were lost or stolen when
Joseph allowed Martin Harris to take them. The Lord
told Joseph not to retranslate the lost portion because
evil men planned to alter the words on the lost pages
and thereby discredit the authenticity of the Book of
Mormon. The Lord told him to translate the history on
the small plates, which covered the same time period.
This history focused more on sacred things. (See D&C
10:10, 41-43; see also 1 Nephi 9:3-4.)

This experience is significant evidence that the Lord
knows all things that are to come. He knew that the
history on the small plates would be needed, and
He prompted Mormon to include the plates with his
abridgment.

How can knowing this truth help you when you
receive promptings from the Spirit?

1. Describe in your scripture study journal a time when

you or someone you know acted on a prompting from the
Holy Ghost even though you or they may not have understood
the prompting at first. Write about how you think you can better
prepare to recognize and respond to the Lord’s promptings.
Remember that as you are faithful to the promptings of the Spirit
of the Lord, He will work “in [you] to do according to his will”
(Words of Mormon 1:7).

Words of Mormon 1:12-18

King Benjamin defeats the Lamanites and reigns in
righteousness

King Benjamin was a righteous king who faced
many obstacles during his reign, including war with
the Lamanites and doctrinal contention among his
people. King Benjamin led the armies of the Nephites
“in the strength of the Lord” against their enemies
and eventually established peace in the land (see
Words of Mormon 1:13-14). With the help of “many
holy men,” he labored to rebuke the false prophets
and false teachers who were causing contention
among the people, thereby also establishing the
peace that comes from righteousness (see Words

of Mormon 1:15-18).

106
Read Words of Mormon 1:12-18, and fill in the blanks
below with the numbers of the verses that best teach
the following truths:

¢ The Lord calls prophets who can lead people
to peace despite challenges.

e We can find peace by following the inspired
leadership of the prophets.

e In the strength of the Lord, we can overcome
challenges.

Mosiah 1:1-18

King Benjamin teaches his sons the importance of the
scriptures

Imagine what your life would be like if you had never
had the scriptures to read, study, and be taught from.

King Benjamin taught his sons how their lives would
have been different if they had not had the scriptures.
As recorded in Mosiah 1:3-—5, three times he used a
variation of the phrase “were it not for these things
[the scriptures]” to help his sons understand the
importance of the scriptures.

2. As you read Mosiah 1:1-8, look for the blessings

the Nephites would have lost if they had not had the
scriptures. Compare what you learned with Omni 1:17-18. In
your scripture study journal, write three or four sentences
completing the following phrase: If | did not have the
scriptures. . .

Consider writing the following principle in your
scriptures next to Mosiah 1:1-8: Searching the
scriptures helps us to know and keep the
commandments.

King Benjamin taught his people the importance of
being faithful to the commandments and explained
what happens to those who become wicked after
having been “highly favored people of the Lord”
(Mosiah 1:13). Read Mosiah 1:13-17, and compare
Mosiah 1:13 with Alma 24:30. Then identify at

least five consequences that come upon those who
turn away from the Lord. You may want to mark or
number these consequences in your scriptures.

Mosiah 2:1-41
The Nephites gather to hear King Benjamin's words

Read Mosiah 2:1—9, and write in answers to the
following questions:

e Who was gathered together?

e Where did they gather?

e What was done so the large crowd could hear King
Benjamin’s words?

To better understand King Benjamin’s character, read
Mosiah 2:11-15 and identify phrases that show King
Benjamin was focused on righteousness and service
rather than status or recognition.

Then ponder the following statement by
President Howard W. Hunter: “Don’t be
overly concerned with status. Do you
recall the counsel of the Savior regarding
those who seek the ‘chief seats’ or the
“uppermost rooms’? ‘He that is greatest
among you shall be your servant.’ (Matt. 23:6, 11.) It is
important to be appreciated. But our focus should be
on righteousness, not recognition; on service, not
status” (“To the Women of the Church,” Ensign, Nov.
1992, 96).

Study Mosiah 2:16-17, and mark the principle we can
learn about service from King Benjamin: When we
are serving our fellow beings, we are serving God.
(Mosiah 2:17 is a scripture mastery passage. You may
want to mark it in a distinctive way so you can locate it
in the future.)

Think about a time when someone blessed your life
by serving you. How did you (or how could you) show
your appreciation to God for the person who served
both you and God in righteousness? How did you
show your appreciation to that person?

After teaching his people about the need to serve others,
King Benjamin taught about the many ways in which
God blesses us and our need to be grateful to Him.

107
3. As you study Mosiah 2:19-24, 34, consider the many

ways in which God blesses you. Think about how you can
show your gratitude to Him. Then answer the following questions
in your scripture study journal:

a. Why would King Benjamin refer to himself, his people, and
us as “unprofitable servants”?

b. Why is it important for us to remember our indebtedness
to God?

King Benjamin’s words teach us that when we feel
indebted to God, we want to serve others and our
gratitude increases.

In Mosiah 2:34, King Benjamin taught that we should
“render” to God all that we have and are. To render
means to “give or submit.” You may want to write the
definition next to this word in your scriptures. Reflect
on how you might give to God all that you have and
are. Remember that as you keep God’s commandments
and seek to give sincere service, He blesses you for it.

The last verses of Mosiah 2 contain an important
warning from King Benjamin to his people. Have

you ever seen a sign that told you to “beware”? (For
example, a sign might warn you about high voltage
wires, fallen rocks, wild animals, or a strong current.)
Read Mosiah 2:32-33, 36-38 to discover what King
Benjamin told his people to beware of. (The word wo in
verse 33 means “sorrow and misery.”) Write a sentence
describing what will happen to those who are “in open
rebellion against God” (verse 37) or who knowingly
break the commandments of God.

Read the following statement: “Some people
knowingly break God’s commandments, planning

to repent later, such as before they go to the temple

or serve a mission. Such deliberate sin mocks the
Savior’s Atonement” (For the Strength of Youth |booklet,
2011], 29).

Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles commented on the importance of recognizing
when we may be withdrawing ourselves from the
Spirit:

“We should ... endeavor to discern when
we ‘withdraw [ourselves] from the Spirit
of the Lord...’ (Mosiah 2:36). ...

“The standard is clear. If something we
think, see, hear, or do distances us from
the Holy Ghost, then we should stop thinking, seeing,
hearing, or doing that thing. If that which is intended
to entertain, for example, alienates us from the Holy
Spirit, then certainly that type of entertainment is not

108

for us. Because the Spirit cannot abide that which is
vulgar, crude, or immodest, then clearly such things
are not for us. Because we estrange the Spirit of the
Lord when we engage in activities we know we should
shun, then such things definitely are not for us” (“That
We May Always Have His Spirit to Be with Us,” Ensign
or Liahona, May 2006, 30).

Ponder what people lose—sometimes without even
realizing it—when they withdraw themselves from the
Spirit. Read Mosiah 2:40—41, and identify what King
Benjamin wanted us to consider and what he wanted
us to remember.

SN. 4. Inyour scripture study journal:

a. Record some experiences that have taught you that
if you are obedient to the Lord, you will be blessed both
temporally and spiritually.

b. Select one area of your life in which you would like to be
more obedient to God's commandments. Write a goal to improve
in that area.

CJ Scripture Mastery—Mosiah 2:17

Read Matthew 22:36—40; 25:40; and Mosiah 2:17. Make
a scripture list, chain, or cluster by cross-referencing
these scriptures together. This scripture study technique
will help clarify meanings and enlarge understanding.

Explain the connections between the passages you just
linked.

Ponder the following questions:

e When have you felt that you were serving God by
serving another person?

e What specific things can you do for someone in your
life that the Savior would do if He were here?

5. After you have worked to memorize Mosiah 2:17,
write it by memory in your scripture study journal.

6. Write the following at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture study journal:

Mosiah 3

Introduction

Continuing his address to his people, King Benjamin
told them that an angel had spoken to him about

the ministry of Jesus Christ. King Benjamin testified
that through faith in Jesus Christ and repentance,
those who have sinned can receive salvation. He also
taught that through the Atonement of Jesus Christ an
individual can overcome the natural man by yielding to
the enticings of the Holy Spirit.

Mosiah 3:1-10

King Benjamin delivers the words of an angel regarding the
Atonement

Draw how much water you would pour
| into the glass if you wanted only a taste.

Draw how much water you would pour
into the glass if you wanted to quench
your thirst.

| Draw how much water you would pour
into the glass if you knew the water
| represented happiness.

As you study Mosiah 3, look for the source of “glad
tidings of great joy” (Mosiah 3:3).

Read Mosiah 3:1-5, and look for what the angel
told King Benjamin. The angel declared that King
Benjamin’s people had reason to rejoice and be filled
with joy.

What was it in the angel’s message that could fill the
Nephites with joy?

Read Mosiah 3:5—-10, and mark words or phrases
about the Savior and His ministry that help you better
appreciate the Savior’s mortal ministry.

1. Select two phrases you marked, and write an
explanation in your scripture study journal about what

they teach you to help you better understand and appreciate
the Savior's ministry.

There are many doctrines and principles taught in
Mosiah 3:5-10. One of the most important is this:
Jesus Christ suffered so we can be saved from our
sins. Consider writing this doctrine in your scriptures
next to Mosiah 3:7-9.

After reading Mosiah 3:7-9, read Luke 22:44 and
Doctrine and Covenants 19:16-18. What additional
insight does Mosiah 3 offer? How does Mosiah 3 help
us appreciate what happened to the Savior?

Read the following statement from Elder James E.
Talmage of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles about
the Savior’s suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane:

“Christ’s agony in the garden is
unfathomable by the finite mind, both as
to intensity and cause... . He struggled
and groaned under a burden such as no
other being who has lived on earth might
even conceive as possible. It was not
physical pain, nor mental anguish alone, that caused
him to suffer such torture as to produce an extrusion
of blood from every pore; but a spiritual agony of soul
such as only God was capable of experiencing... . In
that hour of anguish Christ met and overcame all the
horrors that Satan, ‘the prince of this world’ [John
14:30] could inflict... .

“Tn some manner, actual and terribly real though to
man incomprehensible, the Savior took upon Himself
the burden of the sins of mankind from Adam to the
end of the world” (Jesus the Christ, 3rd ed. [1916], 613).

2. In your scripture study journal, write about an

experience that has helped you know that Jesus Christ is
the Savior. How does remembering this experience add joy to
your life?

To better understand how the Atonement blesses

God’s children, read the following scripture passages
and write a description of the group of people that
verse testifies will be blessed through the Atonement
of Jesus Christ:

¢ Mosiah 3:11

¢ Mosiah 3:16

It is important to know that although Jesus Christ
atoned for the sins of those who do not know the
gospel—those who die in ignorance—they must still
repent and exercise faith in Jesus Christ in the spirit
world in order to be saved (see D&C 131:6; 138:31-34).
Also, the Lord has revealed that children are born
innocent in the sight of God and that Satan has no
power to tempt them. Until they begin to become
accountable at eight years old, little children are saved
through the Atonement of Jesus Christ without needing
to repent or be baptized (see Moroni 8:8-15; D&C
29:46-47; 137:10).

110

We must act on the knowledge we have of the gospel
of Jesus Christ. Read Mosiah 3:12-13, and underline
words and phrases that teach that we can be saved
from our sins and rejoice as we exercise faith in
Jesus Christ and repent.

Recall the image of the cup that was filled with
“happiness.” Remember the angel’s words declaring
that joy comes from understanding the Saviors
mission and Atonement (see Mosiah 3:45). To
understand the opposite of this image, read Mosiah
3:24-27. Underline what those who choose not to
repent will drink at the judgment day.

What will happen to those who choose not to exercise
faith in Jesus Christ and repent?

After teaching his people about the Savior’s
Atonement and the need to repent and have faith
in the Savior, King Benjamin taught his people how
to put off the sinful part of their nature and become
Saints through the Atonement.

Read Mosiah 3:19, and identify any words or phrases
you do not understand. It may be helpful to write three
definitions in your scriptures near this verse. A “natural
man” is a person who chooses to be influenced by the
passions, desires, and appetites of the flesh rather than
the promptings of the Holy Spirit. To “yield” means

to submit to someone or something. “Enticings” are
persuasive or pleasant invitations. Mosiah 3:19 is a
scripture mastery passage. You may want to mark it in

a distinctive way so you can locate it in the future.

3. Write the heading ’To Put Off the Natural Man” in

your scripture study journal. Under this heading, make a
list of what Mosiah 3:19 teaches we must do to overcome the
“natural man.” Circle one action that you feel would be most
important for you to work on at this time. Make a plan to apply
this action.

One of the principles Mosiah 3:19 teaches is that if
we yield to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, we can
overcome the natural man through the Atonement of
Christ.

In your own words, what does it mean to yield “to the
enticings of the Holy Spirit”?

Read the following statement from Elder Neal A.
Maxwell of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles about
putting off the natural man: “Personal righteousness,
worship, prayer, and scripture study are so crucial in
order to ‘[put] off the natural man’ (Mosiah 3:19)”
(“The Tugs and Pulls of the World,” Ensign, Nov.
2000, 36).
4. Answer the following question in your scripture study
journal: In what ways are you seeking to yield to the
enticings of the Holy Spirit in your life?

5. What can you do to more fully yield “to the enticings
of the Holy Spirit” in your own life? Write a goal in your

scripture study journal to help you improve in this area this week.

You might consider working on one of the attributes that help us
become like a child, listed in Mosiah 3:19—for example,
becoming more submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love,
or willing to submit to all things that the Lord sees “fit to inflict
upon” you.

6. Write in your scripture study journal some of the

obstacles in your life that keep you from yielding to the
enticings of the Spirit.

C1) Scripture Mastery—Mosiah 3:19

7. To help you remember or memorize Mosiah 3:19, you

may want to read it through three times. The repetition
will help you become familiar with the content of the verse. After
doing this, try to write as much of the verse, or the ideas in the
verse, as you can in your scripture study journal without referring
to your scriptures. Try repeating the verse aloud at various times,
such as while you are walking, exercising, or preparing for bed.
Doing this for several days in a row can help you memorize and
remember the important principles in this verse.

Mosiah 4

Introduction

King Benjamin’s teachings had a profound effect on
the people who heard him. These people exercised
faith in the Atonement, repented, and received a
remission of their sins. King Benjamin then taught
them what they must do to retain a remission of their
sins. He declared that we are like beggars because we
are completely dependent upon God for our salvation.
King Benjamin warned that we must always watch our
thoughts, deeds, and actions.

Mosiah 4:1-8

The multitude is overcome by the Spirit and receives a
remission of their sins

Imagine that a friend asked, How can I| know if I have
been forgiven of a particular sin? How would you
respond?

Study Mosiah 4:1-3, and look for ideas to help you
answer your friend’s question. Write how you might
respond:

One of the principles taught in these verses is this:
As we exercise faith in Jesus Christ and sincerely
repent, we receive a remission of our sins. Such
repentance is an important element in obtaining joy
and peace of conscience.

Typically, when someone asks us a question we want
to give an answer. This time, as you are thinking about
how to answer your friend’s question, consider how
you could answer the question with a question. Reflect
on Mosiah 4:1-3 and the following statement by Elder
F. Burton Howard, an emeritus member of the Seventy:
“When you have fully repented, you feel an inner
peace. You know somehow you are forgiven because
the burden you have carried for so long, all of a sudden
isn’t there anymore. It is gone and you know it is gone”
(“Repentance,” Ensign, May 1983, 59).

Think of a question you could ask your friend to help
him or her discover how we can know if we have been
forgiven.

It may be helpful to understand two terms in Mosiah
4:1-3 as you think about a question to ask. Viewing
ourselves in our “carnal state” means recognizing our
fallen or earthly condition. Viewing ourselves as “even
less than the dust of the earth” means that the dust
of the earth is obedient to the commands of God (see
Helaman 12:7-8), but God’s children are not always
obedient to His commands.

An example of answering your friend’s question with
a question may be: Do you feel peace of conscience
when you think about having repented of your sin?
Are you filled with joy?

1. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. The people of King Benjamin were forgiven because of the
“exceeding faith which they had in Jesus Christ” (Mosiah 4:3).
What actions recorded in Mosiah 4:1-2 demonstrated their
faith? What attitude and feelings should you have that would
be similar to those of the people of Mosiah?

b. How can you exercise your faith in Jesus Christ as you seek
a remission of your sins?

111
After witnessing his people’s repentant attitudes, King
Benjamin taught them some of the things they must
do to gain salvation. As you read Mosiah 4:48, look
for what we must do to receive salvation.

Explain or give examples of how you are trying to do
the things King Benjamin described:

“Put [your] trust in the Lord”:

“Be diligent in keeping his commandments”:

“Continue in the faith even unto the end of [your]
life”:

Mosiah 4:9-30
King Benjamin teaches how to retain a remission of sins

After the Nephites received a remission of their sins,
King Benjamin taught them how to retain (or keep)
that clean and pure state. Search Mosiah 4:9-11,

26, 28, 30, looking for what we must believe and do
to retain a remission of our sins. Record what you
discover in the following chart:

Retaining a Remission of Sins

Believe Do

King Benjamin taught his people many things, as
recorded in Mosiah 4:9--30, but one of the most
important principles he taught is: If we humble
ourselves before God and strive to develop
Christlike attributes, we can retain a remission
of our sins.

2. King Benjamin taught that we must “believe in God”

(Mosiah 4:9) and always remember "the greatness of
God” (Mosiah 4:11). In your scripture study journal, describe
what experiences you or someone you know have has that have
helped you realize that God is real, that He is powerful, and that
He loves you. Why do you think it is important to understand and
remember God's power, goodness, and love? When you
remember these things, how do they affect your life?

King Benjamin described the actions of people who are
trying to retain a remission of their sins. Study Mosiah
4:12-16 to learn some of the actions King Benjamin
identified. (The word succor in Mosiah 4:16 means to
give relief or assistance in time of need.)

112

3. In your scripture study journal, write about how the

actions described by King Benjamin show that someone
is striving to retain a remission of his or her sins. Can you list a
few other actions that would show someone is striving to retain
a remission of sins? List one or more ways in which you have
given succor to those in need.

King Benjamin compared each of us to a beggar,
for we are each completely dependent upon God
for everything we have. This analogy can help us
appreciate the blessings we have received from the
Lord. Read Mosiah 4:19-21, looking for how each
of us is like a beggar in the sight of God.

Think of your dependence upon God. What is one
blessing that you could thank Heavenly Father for at
this moment?

After teaching that we are in constant need of help
from God, King Benjamin asked us to think about
how we should treat those who ask us for help. Study
Mosiah 4:26-27, looking for how we should treat those
in need.

4. In your scripture study journal, record your answer

to the following question: How can remembering King
Benjamin's teachings in Mosiah 4 help you to be more
compassionate to those who are in spiritual or temporal need?

5. Take a moment to ponder the scriptures you have

studied today. Have you felt an impression from the Holy
Ghost about what you should do, based on what you learned
from the teachings of King Benjamin? Write this impression in
your scripture study journal.

Remember that the Lord has a profound love for you.
As you repent of any wrongdoings and do your best to
follow the Savior’s example, you can retain a remission
of your sins.

Writing Down
Impressions
You Receive

| \~
Elder Richard G. Scott of the
Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles encouraged us to
write down impressions we
receive: “Write down in a
secure place the important
things you learn from the
Spirit. You will find that as you
write down precious impres-
sions, often more will come.
Also the knowledge you gain
will be available throughout
your life. Always, day or night,
wherever you are, whatever
you are doing, seek to recog-
nize and respond to the direc-
tion of the Spirit” (“To Acquire
Knowledge and the Strength
to Use It Wisely,” Ensign, June
2002, 32).

President Ezra Taft
Benson described this
relationship: “Think
clean thoughts. Those
who think clean thoughts
do not do dirty deeds. You
are not only responsible
before God for your acts
but also for controlling
your thoughts... .The
old adage is still true that
you sow thoughts and
you reap acts, you sow
acts and you reap habits,
you sow habits and you
reap a character, and your
character determines
your eternal destiny. ‘As
a man thinketh, so is
he.’ (See Prov. 23:7.) (in
Conference Report, Oct.
1964, 60).

6. As you learn to
control your thoughts,
you will reap the blessing of

being more Christlike in your words and actions. In your scripture
study journal, write one or more ways in which you can control
your thoughts and keep them more Christlike.

UNIT 11: DAY 4

Mosiah 5-6

Introduction

Mosiah 5 concludes King Benjamin’s address to his
people that began in Mosiah 2. As a result of their faith
in King Benjamin’s words, the people experienced a
mighty change of heart. They entered into a covenant
with God and took upon themselves the name of
Jesus Christ. As recorded in Mosiah 6, King Benjamin
transferred his governing power over his kingdom to
his son Mosiah, and Mosiah ruled in righteousness,
following the example of his father.

Mosiah 5:1-4
King Benjamin's people experience a mighty change
Think about the following questions: Have you ever

wished you could change something about yourself?
What did you do about it?

Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles described the need for each of us to
experience a mighty change in our lives: “The essence
of the gospel of Jesus Christ entails a fundamental and
permanent change in our very nature made possible
through our reliance upon ‘the merits, and mercy, and
grace of the Holy Messiah’ (2 Nephi 2:8). As we choose
to follow the Master, we choose to be changed—to be
spiritually reborn” (“Ye Must Be Born Again,” Ensign or
Liahona, May 2007, 20).

You may want to write the following phrase in your
scriptures next to Mosiah 5:2: “As we choose to follow
the Master, we choose to be changed.”

In what ways do you think we choose to change when
we choose to follow Jesus Christ?

Review the chapter summaries for Mosiah 3 and
Mosiah 4 to recall the main focus of King Benjamin’s
address. At the conclusion of his sermon, King
Benjamin asked the people if they believed the words
he had taught them about the Atonement of Jesus
Christ (see Mosiah 5:1). Read Mosiah 5:2-4, and look
for what changed in the hearts of the people after they
listened to their king’s words. As you read, it will be
helpful to know that “disposition” (Mosiah 5:2) refers
to an individual's attitudes, desires, or temperament.

Read the following statement from Elder
David A. Bednar: “The gospel of Jesus
Christ encompasses much more than
avoiding, overcoming, and being cleansed
from sin and the bad influences in our
lives; it also essentially entails doing good,
being good, and becoming better... .To have our
hearts changed by the Holy Spirit such that ‘we have
no more disposition to do evil, but to do good
continually’ (Mosiah 5:2), as did King Benjamin’s
people, is the covenant responsibility we have
accepted. This mighty change is not simply the result
of working harder or developing greater individual
discipline. Rather, it is the consequence of a
fundamental change in our desires, our motives, and
our natures made possible through the Atonement of
Christ the Lord. Our spiritual purpose is to overcome
both sin and the desire to sin” (“Clean Hands and a
Pure Heart,” Ensign, Nov. 2007, 81-82).

113
1. In your scripture study journal, answer the following
questions:
a. What do you think it means to experience a “mighty change”
in your heart? (Mosiah 5:2).
b. When we choose to follow Jesus Christ, why do we need to
change our dispositions and not just our behavior?

c. Why do you think the Atonement of Jesus Christ is necessary
for a change to occur within us?

Study Mosiah 5:2, 4, looking for what the people did
that allowed a mighty change of heart to occur within
them. You might mark these things in your scriptures.
Remember that King Benjamin’s words were about
the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, and the
people had great faith in these words.

One of the principles we learn from these verses
is this: As we exercise faith in Jesus Christ and
receive the Holy Spirit, we can experience a
mighty change of heart.

2. Based on your study of Mosiah 5:1—4 and the principle

above, write in your scripture study journal what you can
do to exercise more faith in the Savior. What specific things can
you do, starting today, to exercise more faith so that you can
encourage and maintain a mighty change of heart in your life?

Mosiah 5:5-15

King Benjamin's people enter into a covenant with God
and are given a new name

After King Benjamin’s people experienced a mighty
change of heart, they desired to enter into a covenant
with the Lord. Identify words or phrases in Mosiah 5:5
that show the level of commitment King Benjamin’s
people felt toward making and keeping this covenant.

When we make covenants with God, He determines
the conditions for the covenants, and we agree to the
conditions. God then promises us certain blessings for
our obedience (see D&C 82:10). Making covenants

is one way we show the Lord we are sincere in our
desires to serve Him.

3. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. What phrases in Mosiah 5:5 remind you of the promises we
renew each time we partake of the sacrament?

b. How do you think making and keeping covenants help you
maintain a mighty ’ change of heart”?

Refer back to Mosiah 1:11-12. One of King Benjamin’s
purposes in gathering his people was to give them a

114

name. Read Mosiah 5:6—7, and mark the name King
Benjamin gave his people after they had made their
covenant with the Lord.

These verses teach this principle: We take upon
ourselves the name of Jesus Christ through sacred
covenants. Read Mosiah 5:8—14, and look for why it
is necessary for us to take upon ourselves the name
of Jesus Christ.

What are some blessings of having the name of Jesus
Christ written in our hearts?

What can cause the name to be “blotted out” of your
heart or someone’s heart?

Read Mosiah 5:15, and look for the promises the Lord
makes to those who keep their covenants.

4. In your scripture study journal, write how you feel

when you think about having the name of Jesus Christ
written in your heart. Write one or more reasons why you want
to keep this name and never lose it.

Mosiah 6:1—7

Mosiah begins his reign as king

Read Mosiah 6:3, and identify what King Benjamin
did before he dismissed the multitude.

What did King Benjamin do to help his people
remember the covenants they had made?

5. In your scripture study journal, write down how
priesthood leaders and teachers help you keep your
covenants.

King Benjamin died three years after he gave his
speech. Read Mosiah 6:6-—7, and look for how King
Mosiah followed his father’s example as a righteous
leader.

| Mosiah 7-8

Introduction

King Mosiah was the son of King Benjamin, who was
the son of the first Mosiah mentioned in the Book

of Mormon. Approximately 80 years before Mosiah
became king, a man named Zeniff led a group of
Nephites from Zarahemla to return to live in the land
of Nephi (see Omni 1:27-30). Mosiah 7 explains that
King Mosiah authorized “a strong and mighty man”
named Ammon (Mosiah 7:3) and a small group to
travel to the land of Nephi (sometimes called the land
of Lehi-Nephi) and determine the fate of Zeniff’s
group. Ammon discovered the descendants of Zeniff’s
people, who were now led by Zeniff’s grandson
Limhi. Ammon’s arrival brought hope to Limhi and
his people, whose iniquities had allowed them to be
placed in bondage to the Lamanites. Earlier, while
attempting to find Zarahemla and ask for help, a group
of Limhi’s people found 24 gold plates with engravings
on them. When Limhi asked Ammon if he could
translate the engravings, Ammon explained that a seer,
like King Mosiah, could translate the ancient records.

Overview of Mosiah 7-24

Have you ever wanted to be delivered from bad
feelings, a painful situation, a challenging or oppressive
circumstance, or guilt from sin? The experiences of the
people you will study about in Mosiah 7—24 can teach
you about deliverance—where to seek it, how to invite
it, and even how to wait for it. Watch for ways you can
apply the stories of Zeniff’s people and their descendants
to your own life, including a desire for deliverance from
something oppressing you.

Before studying Mosiah 7, it will be helpful for you to
become familiar with the various journeys recorded in
Mosiah 7-24. The following activity will provide you
with an overview of these journeys, which occurred
during a period of approximately 80 years (200 B.c. to
120 B.c.). The information in the shaded boxes on the
chart explains what happened between the journeys.

115
Journey | Who Traveled Where

1 Zeniff and other Nephites traveled from
Zarahemla to the land of Nephi, which had
become occupied by Lamanites. These Nephites
fought among themselves, and the survivors
returned to Zarahemla (see Omni 1:27-28;
Mosiah 9:1—2).

2 Zeniff and others left Zarahemla and settled in
the land of Nephi (see Omni 1:29-30; Mosiah
9:3-7).

After Zeniff died, his son Noah reigned in wickedness. The Lord
sent the prophet Abinadi to warn the people to repent. Alma,
one of King Noah’s priests, obeyed Abinadi’s message and
taught it to others (see Mosiah 11-18).

3 Alma escaped to the Waters of Mormon and later
led a group of believers to the land of Helam (see
Mosiah 18:4—5, 32-35; 23:1-5, 19-20).

The Lamanites attacked Noah’s people in the land of Nephi.
Noah was later killed, and his son Limhi reigned. The people of
Limhi were in bondage to the Lamanites (see Mosiah 19-20).

4 Limhi sent a group of Nephites to find Zarahemla.
After becoming lost in the wilderness, the group
discovered the ruins of a destroyed nation and

a record written on 24 gold plates (see Mosiah
8:7—9; 21:25-27).

5 Ammon and 15 others journeyed from Zarahelma
to find those who had returned to the land of
Nephi (see Mosiah 7:1—6; 21:22-24).

6 Limhi and his people escaped from the Lamanites
and were led by Ammon and his brethren to
Zarahemla (see Mosiah 22:10-13).

After Limhi’s people escaped, the Lamanites sent an army
after them. The army was lost in the wilderness when they
discovered Alma and his people in the land of Helam. The
Lamanites brought them into bondage. Alma’s people prayed
for help to escape (see Mosiah 22-24).

7 The Lord delivered Alma and his people and guided
them to Zarahemla (see Mosiah 24:20-25).

Place the number of each journey in the appropriate
circle on the map:

Mosiah 7:1-8:4
Ammon finds the land of Nephi (Lehi-Nephi), and King
Limhi describes how his people came into bondage

In Mosiah 7, Ammon and 15 other strong men traveled
from Zarahemla to learn what happened to the people
whom Zeniff had led to the land of Nephi 80 years
earlier (see Mosiah 7:2; see also journey 5 on the map).
Upon their arrival in the land of Nephi, Ammon and
three of his brethren were seized and cast into prison
(see Mosiah 7:6-11). After two days they were brought
out of prison and questioned by King Limhi, who was
Zeniff’s grandson. Read Mosiah 7:12-15 to see how
Ammon explained his presence in the land of Nephi
and how Limhi responded.

Notice that footnote b for Mosiah 7:14 refers you
to Mosiah 21:25-26. Read these verses to further
understand why Limhi was “exceedingly glad” to
learn where Ammon had come from.

a4

Using what you learned
in Mosiah 21:25-26,
briefly explain why
Limhi was so glad to
learn that Ammon was
from Zarahemla:

Using Footnotes

Footnotes contain helpful
references to other scrip-
tures and related topics in
the index and Topical Guide.
Using footnotes can help
you better understand doc-
trines and principles, story
lines, and difficult words or
concepts. Try studying the
footnotes for several verses
or a chapter as you read
your assignments. Consider
marking footnotes that are
especially helpful.

The group Limhi sent to
seek help found the ruins
of the Jaredite nation.
They mistakenly believed
it was Zarahemla and
that the Nephites there
had been destroyed (see
journey 4 on the map).
You will learn about the
Jaredite nation in the

book of Ether.

King Limhi gathered his people to introduce Ammon
to them. Limhi spoke to his people about their
bondage to the Lamanites and expressed hope that
God would soon deliver them (see Mosiah 7:17-19).
Read Mosiah 7:20, 24-26, and mark the reasons why
Limhi’s people were brought into bondage. (The
prophet mentioned in Mosiah 7:26 is Abinadi, whom
the people had burned to death during wicked King
Noah’s reign, before Ammon’s arrival in the land.)

You may want to mark the phrase “great are the
reasons which we have to mourn” in Mosiah 7:24
to help you remember that iniquity, or sin, has its
consequences. In this case, many were slain as the

Lamanites attacked and the people were brought into
bondage. To mourn means to feel sadness or regret.
Ponder for a moment if you have ever mourned
“because of iniquity.”

Although it is better not to sin, learning from your
mistakes, turning to God for help, and repenting bring
you closer to God. Read Mosiah 7:29-32, and look for
more evidence that Limhi understood the connection
between the iniquities of his people and the sorrow
they were experiencing. (“Reap the chaff” in verse 30
means to receive something useless; “reap the east
wind” in verse 31 means to be destroyed.)

1. Answer the following questions in your scripture
journal:

a. In what ways can consequences for sin be helpful in our
lives? How can we apply our learning and not repeat the sin?

b. Why is it important to recognize and admit how serious our
sins are? Why is it important to feel godly sorrow for them? (see
2 Corinthians 7:10; godly sorrow is a deep realization that our
actions have offended our Father in Heaven). Why is it important
not to delay recognizing and feeling sorrow for our sins?

After Limhi explained to his people the seriousness
of their sins, he encouraged them to do certain things.
Mark what Limhi encouraged his people to do in
Mosiah 7:33.

From the experience of Limhi’s people, we learn

that recognizing our iniquities and feeling godly
sorrow for them can lead us to turn to the Lord for
deliverance.

Imagine that a friend or family member feels remorse for
his or her sins and has a sincere desire to repent and turn
to the Lord but isn’t sure how to do so. Search Mosiah
7:33, and review the phrases that teach how to truly “turn
to the Lord.”

117
2. In your scripture journal, write a letter to this friend

or family member teaching him or her how to turn to the
Lord. Share the three phrases from Mosiah 7:33 you discovered,
and explain the meaning of each phrase by either (1) putting it
in your own words or (2) giving an example of what actions or
attitudes we might see in the life of someone who was striving
to apply that phrase.

Consider if you have sins you have not repented of
that could be causing sorrow and regret for you and
those you love. Elder Richard G. Scott of the Quorum
of the Twelve Apostles provided the following counsel
about beginning the repentance process: “Study and
ponder to determine how serious the Lord defines your
transgression to be. That will bring healing sorrow and
remorse. It will also bring a sincere desire for change
and a willingness to submit to every requirement for
forgiveness” (“Finding Forgiveness,” Ensign, May
1995, 76).

Mosiah 8:5-21

Ammon learns of 24 Jaredite plates and tells Limhi of a
seer who can translate them

Recall from journey 4 on the map at the beginning
of this lesson that the people who tried to find the
way to Zarahemla discovered the ruins of an entire
nation that had been destroyed. They also found 24
gold plates that they took back to Limhi (see Mosiah
8:5-9). Limhi asked Ammon if he knew of anyone
who had the ability to translate the plates (see Mosiah
8:12). Ammon explained that some individuals could
be given power from God to translate. Read Mosiah
8:13, and mark what Ammon called those who have
been given this ability.

Ammon explained that Mosiah, the Nephite king in
Zarahemla, was a seer. Search Mosiah 8:16-18, and
mark the abilities a seer is given in addition to the
power to translate.

These verses teach that the Lord provides prophets,
seers, and revelators to benefit mankind. Today,

each member of the First Presidency and the Quorum
of the Twelve Apostles is a prophet, seer, and revelator.

Elder Neil L. Andersen of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles taught: “These 15 men we sustain as
prophets, seers, and revelators are given divine power
to see what [others] sometimes do not see” (“Beware
of the Evil behind the Smiling Eyes,” Ensign or Liahona,
May 2005, 47).

3. Answer the following questions in your scripture
journal:

a. Why do you think it is wise to listen to those who can see
things that you cannot?

118

b. How have you benefited from listening to modern prophets,
seers, and revelators?

c. What are some of the ways you can learn from modern
prophets, seers, and revelators?

Mosiah 9-10

Introduction

During the reign of King Benjamin, Zeniff led a group
of Nephites from Zarahemla to settle among the
Lamanites in the land of Nephi. Because the king of
the Lamanites planned to bring Zeniff’s people into
bondage, he allowed them to stay. The Lamanites’
false traditions and hatred of the Nephites eventually
led to war. When the Lamanites sought to bring them
into bondage, Zeniff’s people turned to the Lord,
who strengthened them and helped them drive the
Lamanites from their land.

Mosiah 9:1-13

Zeniff leads a group of Nephites to return to the land of
Nephi

Have you ever wanted something very intensely?
Today you will learn about a man who wanted
something intensely and the consequences of his
acting on his desires.

Look at the map of journeys from the last lesson. Do
you remember Ammon’s journey when he found
Limhi and his people? Open your scriptures to Mosiah
7-8, and look at the date when the events in these
chapters took place (found either at the bottom of the
page or in the chapter heading). Compare it with the
date associated with Mosiah 9:1. How many years do
we go back in time between Mosiah 8 and Mosiah 9?

Read Mormon’s preface
to the record of Zeniff
just before Mosiah 9.

Zeniff, Limhi’s
grandfather, led a group
of Nephites to return to
the land of Nephi. He
wanted something so
intensely that he may
have failed to consider
where his desires would

Dates in the Scriptures

Take opportunities to notice
the dates in the Book of
Mormon. Familiarity with
these dates (found in either
the footnotes or chapter sum-
maries) will help you better
understand the sequence of
events you are studying.

lead. Read in Mosiah
9:14 about what Zeniff did to gain what he wanted.
(To be “over-zealous” means to be overly eager or
overly interested in something.)

Zeniff’s overzealousness led him to be deceived by the
Lamanite king. Read Mosiah 9:5—7, 10 to see the result
of Zeniff’s overzealousness.

1. Write answers to the following questions in your
scripture journal:

a. What did Zeniff fail to recognize because of his overzealous
desires to obtain the land of Nephi?

b. What are some modern examples of what some young
people might be overzealous to attain?

c. What do you think are the dangers of being slow to
remember the Lord as you make choices in your life?

After 12 years, Zeniff’s people had become very
prosperous. The Lamanite king grew nervous that

he would not be able to bring them into bondage
according to his original design, so the king prepared his
people to go to war against them (see Mosiah 9:11-13).

Mosiah 9:14—-10:22
The Lamanites attempt to bring Zeniff’s people into bondage

Circle any of the following areas in your life in which
you would like to have more support or strength:
school work, withstanding temptation, relationships
with friends, leadership, work, relationships with family
members, developing skills, talents, and abilities.

As you study Mosiah 9-10, watch for a principle that will
help you understand what to do to receive more strength
in these areas of your life. Mosiah 9-10 contains a record
of two different times when the Lamanites came to
battle against Zeniff and his people.

2. Copy the following chart into your scripture journal,

leaving enough space under each scripture reference to
write an answer. Study the verses indicated, and look for what
Zeniff's people and the Lamanites did to find strength. Fill in the
chart with the information you find.

e What similarities can you see between how Zeniff’s
people and the Lamanites approached the battle?

e What differences can you see between how Zeniff’s
people and the Lamanites approached the battle?

One lesson we learn from Mosiah 9:17-18 is that the
Lord will strengthen us as we do all we can and
put our trust in Him.

3. Answer the following question in your scripture
journal: In what areas of my life can | trust the Lord more
completely and ask Him to strengthen me?

4. Mark the first three lines of Mosiah 9:18. Then ask a

trusted adult (a parent, Church leader, or teacher) to
share an experience with you about a time when he or she asked
the Lord for help and felt strengthened by Him. Listen for what
the person did to receive the Lord’s strength. Write about what
you learn in your scripture journal.

119
Have you ever been angry with someone and held a
grudge—felt like you could not forgive or forget what
the person did? Have you ever known someone who
seemed to hate you? Before Zeniff and his people
went to battle the second time, Zeniff taught his
people why the Lamanites were filled with hatred
toward the Nephites. As you study Zeniff’s words in
Mosiah 10:11-18, it might be helpful to know that to
be “wronged” is to feel offended or dealt with unfairly
or in an unjust manner and to be “wroth” is to be
intensely angry. Study Mosiah 10:11-18, and look for
why the descendants of Laman and Lemuel continued
to hate the descendants of Nephi. Mark the words
wronged and wroth as you read.

Ponder the following questions:

e Why did the Lamanites hate the Nephites so
intensely?

e¢ Whom does it hurt when you are angry or refuse to
forgive?

¢ How could anger and holding grudges affect your
family or your future children?

Read the following experiences from Elder Donald L.
Hallstrom of the Presidency of the Seventy, and

look for what he recommended we do when we feel
offended or angry with someone:

“Many years ago, I observed a
heartbreak—which became a tragedy. A
young couple was nearing the delivery of
their first child. Their lives were filled with
the anticipation and excitement of this
monumental experience. During the
delivery, complications arose and the baby died.
Heartbreak turned to grief, grief turned to anger, anger
turned to blame, and blame turned to revenge toward
the doctor, whom they held fully responsible. Parents
and other family members became heavily involved,
together seeking to ruin the reputation and the career
of the physician. As weeks and then months of
acrimony [sharp, bitter language] consumed the family,
their bitterness was extended to the Lord. ‘How could
He allow this horrible thing to occur?’ They rejected
the repeated efforts of Church leaders and members to
spiritually and emotionally comfort them and, in time,
disassociated themselves from the Church. Four
generations of the family have now been affected.
Where once there were faith and devotion to the Lord
and His Church, there has been no spiritual activity by
any family member for decades... .

“My paternal grandparents had two children, a son
(my father) and a daughter. . . . [Their daughter]
married in 1946 and four years later was expecting a

120

child. . .. No one knew that she was carrying twins.
Sadly, she and the twins all died during childbirth.

“My grandparents were heartbroken. Their grief,
however, immediately turned them to the Lord and
His Atonement. Without dwelling on why this could
happen and who might be to blame, they focused on
living a righteous life... .

“The faithfulness of [these grandparents], especially
when faced with difficulty, has now influenced

four generations that have followed. Directly and
profoundly, it affected their son (my father) and

my mother when my parents’ own daughter, their
youngest child, died due to complications caused by
giving birth... . With the example that they had seen
in the previous generation, my parents—without
hesitation—turned to the Lord for solace. .. .

“Tf you feel you have been wronged—by anyone

(a family member, a friend, another member of the
Church, a Church leader, a business associate) or by
anything (the death of a loved one, health problems,
a financial reversal, abuse, addictions)—deal with the
matter directly and with all the strength you have... .
And, without delay, turn to the Lord. Exercise all of
the faith you have in Him. Let Him share your burden.
Allow His grace to lighten your load... . Never let an
earthly circumstance disable you spiritually” (“Turn to
the Lord,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2010, 78-80).

Notice that in both the example of the Lamanites and
the family of the young couple who lost their first
child, the anger and offense affected generations of

people.

5. Think of a time when you had feelings of being

wronged or of anger toward someone? Do you have
some of those feelings currently? Answer the following
questions in your scripture journal:

a. How could | receive help in my efforts to forgive?

b. How can | follow the example of Elder Hallstrom’s
grandparents and apply his counsel in the last paragraph of
the quotation in my life today?

6. Write the following at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture journal:

Mosiah 11-14

Introduction

King Noah took great pleasure in riotous living and led
many of his people into wickedness. The Lord sent the
prophet Abinadi to call Noah’s people to repentance
and warn them of impending bondage. The people
chose not to heed the warnings, and Abinadi was
imprisoned for his prophecies. When the priests of
King Noah questioned Abinadi, the prophet rebuked
them for not living or teaching the commandments.
God protected Abinadi and gave him power to finish
his message to King Noah and his priests. Quoting
Isaiah, Abinadi testified of all people’s need to rely on
Jesus Christ and His Atonement.

Mosiah 11:1-19
King Noah leads his people into wickedness

Consider the following questions:

¢ What would you do if your parent, guardian, or
leader suggested that some of your friends were
having a bad influence on you?

e What would you do if one of your parents or a Church
leader asked you to dress more appropriately for Sun-
day worship services and other Church activities?

¢ What would you do if the prophet said that you
needed to change your entertainment standards?

People may react differently to the questions above.
As you study this lesson, watch for how the Lord
would want you to respond to the people He sends
to help you live righteously.

As you prepare to study Mosiah 11, it may be helpful to
know that after Zeniff died, his son Noah ruled over the
Nephites who were in the land of Nephi. Read Mosiah
11:1-2, 5-7, 14-19, and mark words and phrases that
describe Noah’s actions and what he sought for after
becoming king. Then read Mosiah 11:2, 6-7, 15, 19,

and mark in a different color (if you can) the influence
Noabh’s actions had on the people of the kingdom.

These verses illustrate how the people we associate
with may influence our actions. Consider how your
peers influence the choices you make. Ponder for a
moment what people in today’s world sometimes do
that could be likened unto laboring “exceedingly to
support iniquity” (Mosiah 11:6).

Mosiah 11:20-12:17

Abinadi urges the people to repent and warns them of
bondage

Although King Noah and his people were choosing
wickedness, the Lord still loved them and wanted to
help them. Scan the first four lines of Mosiah 11:20,
and identify what the Lord did to help Noah’s people.

Write the following truth in your scriptures next
to Mosiah 11:20: God sends prophets to help us
repent and avoid misery.

The Lord commanded Abinadi two different times to
warn the people.

1. Copy the following chart into your scripture journal,

leaving enough space under each scripture reference to
write a summary. Study the verses indicated, and write a
summary of Abinadi’s warnings and the people's reactions.

Abinadi's Message | The People’s

Reaction

First Warning | Mosiah 11:20-25 Mosiah 11:26-29

Second Mosiah 12:1-8

Warning

Mosiah 12:9-10,
13-17

2. In your scripture journal, answer the following
questions about the people’s reactions to Abinadi’s
warnings:
a. Why do you think the people reacted angrily to Abinadi, who
was trying to help them? Why do you think they defended King
Noah, who was leading them toward misery?
b. Note the phrase “the eyes of the people were blinded” in
Mosiah 11:29. What are some examples of behaviors and
influences you believe Satan is working diligently to have good
people become “blinded” to in today’s world?
c. What can you do to demonstrate humility when family
members, Church leaders, and prophets encourage you to
follow the word of God?

Mosiah 12:18-13:26

God protects Abinadi as he rebukes King Noah and
his priests for their failure to observe and teach the
commandments

Before continuing your study of Mosiah 12, rate
yourself on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being in full
agreement) on how well the following statements
describe you right now:

I know what I should be doing to live the
gospel of Jesus Christ.

I live the gospel of Jesus Christ.

121
As you learn about King Noah and his priests,
consider how well they knew and how well they lived
the commandments. After Noah brought Abinadi out
of prison, the priests began to question him about
the scriptures. Read Mosiah 12:26-30, and mark
what Abinadi said to rebuke Noah and his priests.

How well do you think Noah and his priests would
rate on the 1 to 10 scale of knowing and living the
commandments? What do you think it means to
apply our “hearts to understanding”? (see Mosiah
12:27). Look in Mosiah 12:33, and underline a
principle that indicates why it is important to live
the commandments.

Abinadi declared this truth: If we keep the
commandments of God, we shall be saved. Why is
knowing the way to live not enough to qualify us for
salvation?

Abinadi told King Noah and his priests that they were
not living or teaching the commandments, and he
began to list the Ten Commandments. This angered
the king, and he commanded that Abinadi be put to
death. God protected Abinadi and gave him power

122

to continue teaching about the Ten Commandments.
You might want to mark and number them in Mosiah
12:35-36 and Mosiah 13:12-24. The following chart
will help you identify each of the Ten Commandments:

Abinadi Taught the Ten Commandments

1. Mosiah 12:35

2. Mosiah 12:36; 13:12-13

3. Mosiah 13:15

4. Mosiah 13:16-19

5. Mosiah 13:20

6. Mosiah 13:21

7. Mosiah 13:22

8. Mosiah 13:22

9. Mosiah 13:23

10. Mosiah 13:24

Abinadi boldly rebuked Noah and his priests for not
keeping the Ten Commandments, saying, “I perceive

that they are not written in your hearts” (Mosiah 13:11).

To help you think about how well you are living the Ten
Commandments, fill out the following self-evaluation:

The statements below may indi-
cate how well the Ten Command-
ments are written in your heart.
Mark how often these statements
are true for you.

Almost never
Some of the time
Much of the time
Almost always

| love my Heavenly Father.

| put God first in my life (before
friends, hobbies, possessions, my own
desires, and other things).

| speak the Lord’s name with
reverence.

| keep the Sabbath day holy by
participating in activities that draw me
closer to the Lord; | recognize it as His
day, not mine.

| honor my parents by being obedient
and respectful.

| control my anger and do not act
violently toward others.

| am sexually pure. | avoid lustful
images, language, and actions.

| refrain from stealing and cheating.

| tell the truth.

| avoid coveting (which means to
inappropriately desire something that
belongs to someone else).

3. Look back at your responses and set a goal to better
live one of the Ten Commandments. Write your goal in
your scripture journal.

Mosiah 13:27-14:12
Abinadi teaches about the coming of Jesus Christ

Read Mosiah 13:28, 32-35, and mark any words or
phrases that could complete the following quotation
by Elder Dallin H. Oaks of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles: “After all our obedience and good works,
we cannot be saved from death or the effects of our

individual sins without

The full quotation by Elder Oaks reads: “After all our
obedience and good works, we cannot be saved from
death or the effects of our individual sins without the
grace extended by the atonement of Jesus Christ”
(“Another Testament of Jesus Christ,” Ensign, Mar.
1994, 67).

You may want to write this truth next to Mosiah
13:28: No one can be saved except through the
Atonement of Jesus Christ.

Spend a few minutes studying Mosiah 14:1-12, and
mark words and phrases that describe what Jesus
Christ did in mortality to help you return home to
our Father in Heaven. Think about the grief, sorrows,
and sins Jesus Christ has carried for you. These verses
correspond with Isaiah 53:1-12. Abinadi was quoting
what Isaiah had written (see Mosiah 14:1).

4. \n your scripture journal, write how you would explain
what Mosiah 14:4—5 teaches about Jesus Christ to a friend.

5. Write the following at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture journal:

| have studied Mosiah 11-14 and completed this lesson on (date).

Additional questions, thoughts, and insights | would like to share
with my teacher:

Mosiah 15-17

Introduction

The record of the prophet Abinadi’s preaching to King
Noah and his priests continues in Mosiah 15-17. He
testified of Jesus Christ’s role as the Redeemer. One
of Noah’s priests, Alma, believed Abinadi. King Noah
cast Alma out of his court and had Abinadi burned to
death. Abinadi was true to God in all circumstances.

Mosiah 15-16
Abinadi teaches about Jesus Christ's role as Redeemer

Take a few minutes to find and circle the words
redeem, redeemed, and redemption in Mosiah 15-16.
The repetition of a word in a block of scripture often
signals an important point in the writer’s message. As
you study today, watch for what Abinadi taught about
being redeemed.

123
To help you understand Jesus Christ’s role as
Redeemer, consider the following diagram:

Fines?
Prison?
Death?

Offender Punishment

Imagine you have broken a law and have been
sentenced to the harshest penalty the law allows.
Perhaps the punishment includes large fines, time in
prison, or even death. How might you feel facing such
penalties? Can you think of any legal and honest way
to escape these punishments?

Write Me under the word Offender and Justice under
the word Punishment in the diagram. We have all
broken the laws of God at some time and must meet

the demands of justice. The demands of justice require
each sinner to receive the punishment connected to
the sin.

Read the following statement by Elder
Richard G. Scott of the Quorum of the
Twelve Apostles, and underline the two
consequences of breaking God’s laws:
“Justice . . . requires that every broken law
be satisfied. When you obey the laws of
God, you are blessed, but there is no additional credit
earned that can be saved to satisfy the laws that you
break. If not resolved, broken laws can cause yout life
to be miserable and would keep you from returning to
God” (“The Atonement Can Secure Your Peace and
Happiness,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2006, 42).

The consequences of breaking God’s laws include
misery and being unable to live with God. Read
Mosiah 15:1, 7-9, and mark phrases that indicate
how the Savior’s Atonement satisfies the demands
of justice.

Use a dictionary to find definitions for the following
words:

Redeem (Mosiah 15:1)

Intercession (Mosiah 15:8)

Betwixt (Mosiah 15:9)

You may want to write part of these definitions next to
the verses.

124

Sometimes people are confused by Abinadi’s description
of Jesus Christ in Mosiah 15:2-5 as (1) the Son of God
the Father and (2) as the Father. The following statement
by Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles explains Jesus Christ’s divine nature this way:
“As Abinadi taught, Christ was ‘conceived by the power
of God’ (Mosiah 15:3) and therefore has the powers of
the Father within him. In addition to that divine lineal
relationship, Christ also acts as the Father in that he is
the Creator of heaven and earth [see Mosiah 15:4], is
the father of our spiritual rebirth and salvation, and is
faithful in honoring—and therefore claiming the power
of—the will of his Father above that of his own will”
(Christ and the New Covenant [1997], 183-84).

Study Mosiah 15:5-7, thinking about the price Jesus
Christ paid to redeem you, or to stand between you
and the demands of justice. On the diagram above,

write Jesus Christ between Offender and Punishment.

It is important to understand that the Savior does
not erase the demands of justice but stands between
justice and us. If we repent, He satisfies justice’s
demands by taking the punishment in our behalf.

1. Complete the following activities in your scripture
journal:
a. Write Those Who Choose to Be Redeemed (Mosiah 15:11-12;
16:13). Then search Mosiah 15:11-12; 16:13, looking for who
will be redeemed. Describe what you found.
b. Write Those Who Refuse to Be Redeemed (Mosiah 15:26-27,
16:2-5, 12). Then search Mosiah 15:26-27; 16:2—-5, 12, looking
for why some people will not be redeemed. Describe what you
found.

2. Using what you learned in the previous assignment,
answer the following questions in your scripture journal:

a. What will determine who will be redeemed from their sins?
b. What do you learn from the contrast of the “will” of Jesus

Christ in Mosiah 15:7 and the “will” of those who do evil in
Mosiah 16:12?

Jesus Christ satisfies the demands of justice for
all who will repent. The price the Savior paid for us
is a very personal gift for any who choose to repent
and do the will of the Father. Read Mosiah 15:10, and
underline the phrase “he shall see his seed.”

Read Mosiah 15:10-12 and the following
statement by Elder Merrill J. Bateman, an
emeritus member of the Seventy:

“The prophet Abinadi . . . states that
‘when his soul has been made an offering
for sin he shall see his seed’ (Mosiah
15:10). Abinadi then identifies the Savior’s seed as the
prophets and those who follow them. For many years

I thought of the Savior’s experience in the garden
and on the cross as places where a large mass of sin
was heaped upon Him. Through the words of Alma,
Abinadi, Isaiah, and other prophets, however, my
view has changed. Instead of an impersonal mass
of sin, there was a long line of people, as Jesus felt
‘our infirmities’ (Hebrews 4:15), ‘[bore] our griefs,
... carried our sorrows .. . [and] was bruised for our
iniquities’ (Isaiah 53:4—5).

“The Atonement was an intimate, personal experience
in which Jesus came to know how to help each of

us” (“A Pattern for All,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2005,
75-76).

3. Answer the following questions in your scripture
journal:

a. What do you think it means to become the seed of Jesus
Christ? (see Mosiah 15:12).

b. What are you doing to make sure you are numbered among
the seed of Jesus Christ?

You may wish to personalize Mosiah 15:10 by writing
your name in place of “his seed” in the portion of the
verse that you have underlined. Ponder for a moment
what it means to have a Redeemer who has seen and
knows you personally.

What are the consequences of someone refusing to be
redeemed? Look again at Mosiah 16:5. What happens
in the diagram depicted earlier in this lesson if the
offender persists in sin and refuses to repent? Read
Doctrine and Covenants 19:16—-17 to discover what
will happen to those who refuse to accept the Savior’s
redeeming act through repentance.

Abinadi taught that the redemption of Jesus Christ
includes not only a rescue from sin but also from death.
Everyone will be resurrected; however, some will be
resurrected before others. Abinadi used the term “first
resurrection” to explain that the righteous and innocent
would be resurrected before the rebellious (see Mosiah
15:21-22). The righteous will be redeemed from
death in the first resurrection and the wicked must
wait to be resurrected until after the Millennium (see
D&C 76:85, 106).

4. Reflect upon the verses you have studied in Mosiah 15.

Imagine you had the opportunity for a messenger to deliver
a message from you to the Savior. Record what you would write in
that message, based upon what He has done for you.

The Savior wants to bring us back into the presence

of our Heavenly Father. He intercedes, mediates, and
pleads on our behalf. The Savior has paid the demands
of justice for us if we will repent.

Mosiah 17

Alma believes Abinadi and is cast out; Abinadl is killed

Have you ever witnessed someone stand up for what
was right when it was difficult for him or her to do so?
What was the outcome?

When Abinadi concluded his message, one of the
priests, named Alma, tried to convince the king that
Abinadi had spoken the truth and should be released.
The king cast Alma out and sent servants to slay him.
Alma hid and wrote the words of Abinadi.

Alma’s conversion is significant. Because he recorded
the words of Abinadi, many generations and peoples
have been blessed. The fruits of Alma’s conversion will
be more apparent as you study the upcoming chapters.
The king and his priests counseled together for three
days before sentencing Abinadi to death (see Mosiah
17:1-6, 13).

125
5. Mosiah 17:7-10 and Mosiah 17:11-12 compare the

choices made by Abinadi and King Noah. After studying
these verses, give short answers for the following questions in

President Gordon B. Hinckley declared: “Be strong—in
standing for the right. We live in an age of compromise
and acquiescence. In situations with which we are daily
confronted, we know what is right, but under pressure
from our peers and the beguiling voices of those who
would persuade us, we capitulate. We compromise.

We acquiesce. We give in, and we are ashamed of
ourselves. ...We must cultivate the strength to follow
our convictions” (“Building Your Tabernacle,” Ensign,
Nov. 1992, 52).

Mosiah 18

Introduction

Alma, who was a priest of the wicked King Noah,
believed the words of the prophet Abinadi and
repented of his sins. After Abinadi’s death, Alma
privately taught others about Jesus Christ. Those who
believed Alma were desirous to come into the fold of
God. They entered into the covenant of baptism at

a place called the Waters of Mormon. As you study
Mosiah 18, look for what Alma taught concerning the
promises you make when you are baptized and what
the Lord will do for you as you keep those promises.

Mosiah 18:1-16
Alma teaches and baptizes the people

Think about your baptism. What details do you
remember about the experience? How were you
prepared for your baptism? What feelings do you recall
about your baptism? Ponder what you may appreciate
even more about your baptism now than you did when
you were baptized.

Mosiah 18 helps us understand the covenant we make
with God at baptism. A covenant is “an agreement
between God and man, but they do not act as equals
in the agreement. God gives the conditions for the
covenant, and men agree to do what he asks them to
do. God then promises men certain blessings for their
obedience” (Guide to the Scriptures, “Covenant,”
scriptures.Ids.org).

To see how Mosiah 18 helps us understand the
baptismal covenant, note the following outline of this
chapter: Mosiah 18:1—7, Preparing for the Covenant;
Mosiah 18:8-16, Making the Covenant; and Mosiah
18:17-30, Living the Covenant. You may want to write
each topic (for example, Preparing for the Covenant)
next to the corresponding verses in your scriptures.

Read Mosiah 18:1-2, 6-7, looking for the doctrines
and principles Alma taught the people to help prepare
them for baptism. In the space below, write how an
understanding of what Alma taught his people would
help someone today to prepare for baptism:

Mosiah 18:8-11 records how Alma helped his people
understand the promises they would make and receive
through the covenant of baptism.

1. Draw the diagram below in your scripture study

journal. Search Mosiah 18:8—-11 for what Alma taught
about the promises we make to God (what we “are willing” to
do) and the promises God makes to us when we are baptized.
Write what you discover in the appropriate columns of your
diagram.

I Promise God Promises

One of the gospel principles evident in Mosiah 18:8-11
is: We receive the Spirit of the Lord and the promise
of eternal life by making and keeping the covenant
of baptism.

2. At the bottom of the diagram in your scripture study
journal, write a summary of what you have learned about
the importance of making and keeping the baptismal covenant.

Read the following statement by Elder Joseph B.
Wirthlin of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and
underline the blessings that can come to us as we
understand the promises we make and receive at
baptism: “I have noted throughout my life that when
people come to fully understand the blessings and the
power of their baptismal covenant, whether as new
converts or as lifelong members of the Church, great
joy comes into their lives and they approach their
duties in the kingdom with contagious enthusiasm”
(“Alma the Elder: A Role Model for Today,” in Heroes
from the Book of Mormon [1995], 84).

3. Write in your scripture study journal about how your

baptismal covenant can affect the way you live each day.
(For example, consider your promise to “stand as witnesses of
God at all times” as it relates to the way you interact with others,
including how you treat family members, the things you discuss
with friends and acquaintances, the language you use, the kinds
of movies or television shows you watch, the music you listen to,
social and dating relationships, and how you respond to those
who criticize your beliefs.)

Carefully search Mosiah 18:12-16, and identify
examples of how the Lord fulfilled His part of the
covenant with Alma and his people after their baptism.
You may want to mark what you find.

4. Write in your scripture study journal about a time when
you felt the Lord blessed you with His Spirit as you kept the
promise you made at baptism to serve Him.

127
Mosiah 18:17-30

Alma establishes the Church of Jesus Christ among the
people

How often do you think about the covenants you
made at baptism and renew when you partake of the
sacrament? How often should you think about them?
When do you usually take time to think about these
covenants?

President Henry B. Eyring of the First
Presidency taught the importance of
keeping our covenants with the Lord:
“The Latter-day Saints are a covenant
people. From the day of baptism through
the spiritual milestones of our lives, we
make promises with God and He makes promises with
us. He always keeps His promises offered through His
authorized servants, but it is the crucial test of our lives
to see if we will make and keep our covenants with
Him” (Witnesses for God,” Ensign, Nov. 1996, 30).

Read Mosiah 18:17-18, 20-23, 27-29, looking for

how members of the Church in Alma’s day kept their
baptismal covenants. You may want to mark specific
words and phrases in Mosiah 18:22, 26, 30 that indicate
that great blessings come to those who keep their
baptismal covenants.

5. Answer the following questions in your scripture

study journal: What is one thing you will do to better
keep the covenants you made at baptism? How will you keep
this commitment?

Mosiah 18:31-35

Those who belong to the Church flee from the persecution
of King Noah

Study Mosiah 18:31-33 to learn what King Noah was
doing in the city of Lehi-Nephi while Alma and his
people were enjoying great blessings near the Waters
of Mormon. Read Mosiah 18:34 and then Mosiah
23:1-2 to find out how Alma was “apprised” of the
danger his people faced.

Consider writing this truth next to Mosiah 18:34: The
Lord can warn the righteous when they are in
danger.

Read the following experience shared by Elder Neil L.
Andersen of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles that
illustrates this truth:

128

“Working as a special agent for the FBI,
my friend investigated organized crime
groups transporting illegal drugs into the
United States.

“On one occasion, he and another agent
approached an apartment where they believed a
known drug dealer was distributing cocaine. My friend
describes what happened:

“We knocked on the door of the drug dealer. The
suspect opened the door, and upon seeing us, tried to
block our view. But it was too late; we could see the
cocaine on his table.

““A man and a woman who were at the table
immediately began removing the cocaine. We had

to prevent them from destroying the evidence, so I
quickly pushed the drug suspect who was blocking
the door to the side. As I pushed him, my eyes met his.
Strangely, he did not appear angry or afraid. He was
smiling at me.

“His eyes and disarming smile gave me the
impression that he was harmless, so I quickly left him
and started to move toward the table. The suspect was
now behind me. At that instant, I had the distinct,
powerful impression come into my mind: “Beware of
the evil behind the smiling eyes.”

“7 immediately turned back toward the suspect. His
hand was in his large front pocket. Instinctively I
grabbed his hand and pulled it from his pocket. Only
then did I see, clutched in his hand, the semiautomatic
pistol ready to fire. A flurry of activity followed, and I
disarmed the man.’ ...

“...The Holy Ghost warned my friend of physical
danger; the Holy Ghost will also warn you of spiritual
danger” (“Beware of the Evil behind the Smiling Eyes,
Ensign or Liahona, May 2005, 46-47).

a”

6. Write in your scripture study journal about feelings

you have had from the Holy Ghost or experiences you
remember where you have been warned of or protected from
physical or spiritual danger, or write about the experiences of
someone you know or have read or heard about.

Mosiah 19-20

Introduction

After Alma and his people escaped from King Noah’s
army, the people who remained with Noah began to
suffer the consequences prophesied by Abinadi.The
account of the Nephites in the land of Lehi-Nephi
reminds us that when we reject the counsel of the
Lord’s servants, we experience serious consequences.
On the other hand, when we obey the prophets, we
enjoy peace and safety even through our trials. As you
study this lesson, think about how you can receive the
peace and safety that come from hearkening to the
counsel of the Lord’s modern prophets.

The Nephites in the land of Lehi-Nephi experience the
fulfillment of Abinadi's prophecies

Read the following experience shared by Elder
David R. Stone, who was then serving as a member
of the Seventy, and think about the significance of
spiritual warnings we receive through prophets:

“One Sunday morning ... we awoke to a beautiful
day in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.
The Caribbean sun was shining, and the sky was clear.
A gentle breeze was blowing, barely ruffling the leaves
on the trees; it was warm and peaceful and still. But
far out to sea, beyond the reach of our physical senses
that day, the deadly destroyer was coming our way,
implacable and irresistible. The Hurricane Center,
with responsibility to track and predict the path of
Hurricane Georges, was constantly updating the
information available on the Internet. In the peaceful,
placid quiet of that morning, by virtue of those seeing
eyes in the sky, I saw the predicted path of the storm,
aimed like an arrow at the heart of Santo Domingo.

“Within 48 hours the storm struck the island with
intense . . . fury, leaving in its path destruction,
desolation, and death. .. .

“Great as the damage and destruction and death from
these awesome phenomena of physical force can be,
there is even more desolation caused in people’s lives
by spiritual hurricanes. These furious forces often cause
far more devastating damage than physical cyclones,
because they destroy our souls and rob us of our
eternal perspective and promise... .

129
“We place ourselves in the path of these spiritual
hurricanes when we indulge in anger, alcohol, and
abuse; lust and licentiousness; promiscuity and
pornography; drugs, pride, greed, violence, envy, and
lies—the list is long. .. .

“But we also have our spiritual hurricane guardians,
those whose calling it is to watch and warn, helping
us avoid spiritual damage, destruction, and even
death. Our watchmen on the tower are known to us
as apostles and prophets. They are our spiritual eyes in
the sky, and they know, through inspiration and insight
and pure intelligence, the course these storms may
take. They continue to raise their voices in warning

to tell us of the tragic consequences of willful and
wanton violations of the Lord’s commandments. To
intentionally ignore their warnings is to court misery,
sorrow, and ruin. To follow them is to follow the
chosen servants of the Lord into spiritual pastures of
peace and plenty” (Spiritual Hurricanes,” Ensign, Nov.
1999, 31-32).

Take a moment and ponder what dangers you have
heard prophets and apostles warn us about. How can
their words protect us from “spiritual hurricanes”?

God sent Abinadi to warn the people of Lehi-Nephi of
the destruction that was coming if they did not repent.

1. Copy the following chart into your scripture study
journal, leaving enough room to write under each
reference:

Fulfillment Mosiah 19:10,
14-15; 20:20-21; 21:3-4, 8,
10-13)

Prophecy about King Noah's
people (Mosiah 12:1—2)

Prophecy about King Noah Fulfillment Mosiah 19:18-20)

(Mosiah 12:3)

A. B.

Review Abinadi’s prophecies to the Nephites in the land of Lehi-
Nephi by reading the scripture references in the left column of
the chart. Under the appropriate scripture references, write the
consequences Abinadi said King Noah and his people would face
if they did not repent. At the bottom of the left column (A), write
how you think you might have felt and what you might have
done if you had heard Abinadi’s warnings.

Before you begin working on the right column of the
chart, complete the activity below in the manual. This
activity will help you become more familiar with the
events of Mosiah 19-20 and to recognize the fulfillment
of Abinadi’s prophecies recorded in these chapters.

130

As you study Mosiah 19-20, number the following

11 events in the order in which they occur in the
scriptures. The chapter summaries at the beginning of
each chapter will provide helpful clues to guide you.

Gideon seeks to kill King Noah.

Nephite women and children plead with the Lamanites not to slay
them.

King Noah suffers death by fire.
The Lamanite army comes into the borders of Shemlon.

Priests of King Noah abduct (kidnap) 24 daughters of the
Lamanites.

The Lamanite king pleads with his army to spare the people of
Limhi.

Some of Noah's people flee before the Lamanites, leaving the
women and children behind.

Limhi orders his people not to slay the Lamanite king.
There is peace between the Nephites and Lamanites for two years.

Limhi promises that his people will pay one-half of their
possessions to the Lamanites.

The Nephites repel a Lamanite attack and capture the Lamanite king.

(The answers to this activity are found at the end of
this lesson.)

2. After you have successfully numbered the 11

statements, return to the chart in your scripture study
journal. Search the scriptures in the right column for details
about how Abinadi’s prophecies were fulfilled. Record these
details in your chart in the right column. At the bottom of the
right column (B), explain what you have learned about the
consequences of rejecting a prophet’s words of warning.

Read Mosiah 20:21, and mark Gideon’s statement that
shows his understanding that rejecting the words of
the Lord’s servants brings suffering and sorrow.

Read Doctrine and Covenants 133:63, 70-72 to see
how this principle applies to those in the last days
who will not listen to the Lord or His servants. You
may want to write this reference in your scriptures as
a cross-reference for Mosiah 20:21. Look at the most
recent general conference addresses in the Ensign or
Liahona magazines (May and November issues) or
on LDS.org to find words of the prophets concerning
these matters.

Ponder this question: What have you heard prophets
teach recently that would help individuals, families,
and nations avoid suffering and sorrow?

To see an example of the sorrow and suffering that
can come from rejecting the Lord’s prophets, look for
the consequences that Elder Dallin H. Oaks of the
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles said would come to
those who engage in pornography:

“Pornography impairs one’s ability to enjoy
a normal emotional, romantic, and spiritual
relationship with a person of the opposite
sex. It erodes the moral barriers that stand
against inappropriate, abnormal, or illegal
behavior. As conscience is desensitized,
patrons of pornography are led to act out what they
have witnessed, regardless of its effects on their life

and the lives of others.

“Pornography is also addictive. It impairs
decision-making capacities and it ‘hooks’ its users,
drawing them back obsessively for more and more”
(“Pornography,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2005, 89).

Think of some examples of the sorrow and suffering
that come from ignoring the prophets’ counsel on
subjects such as gambling, pornography, the Word of
Wisdom, cheating, tattoos, body piercing, dressing
immodestly, or dating before the age of 16.

3. Answer the following question in your scripture study

journal: How could following counsel from the Lord’s
servants on topics such as strengthening families, living the law
of chastity, or obeying the Word of Wisdom help individuals and
families avoid some of the suffering and sorrow they experience?

Elder Robert D. Hales of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles testified that we can have peace and return
to God’s presence by following prophets:

“T give my testimony that the prophets of this day
have the qualities of the prophets of old and the other
prophets of this dispensation. .. .

“.., Our spiritual safety lies in turning to the clear
voice of our living prophet. If we listen to his voice
and obey his counsel, we will be able to live as Christ
would have us live and endure to the end so that one
day we, along with our families, will return back into
the presence of our Heavenly Father and our Savior
Jesus Christ” (”Hear the Prophet’s Voice and Obey,”
Ensign, May 1995, 17).

4. Write in your scripture study journal about how you

would like your study of Mosiah 19-20 to affect the way
you listen to the counsel of the Lord’s prophets. Think of an
experience about how you have received peace and spiritual
safety by following the counsel of the Lord's servants and record
it in your scripture study journal.

Mosiah 21-24

Introduction

Limhi’s people came into Lamanite bondage as a
result of their wickedness (see Mosiah 20:21); they
were humbled and turned to God as a result of their
bondage. Alma’s people were brought into bondage
as a trial of their faith (see Mosiah 23:21). Both groups
prayed mightily to be released from bondage. While
both groups of people were eventually delivered and
arrived in Zarahemla, the Lord helped each group in
different ways. From studying the trials and deliverance
of Limhi’s group, you can see the Lord will answer
our prayers in His own way and time as we humble
ourselves. From studying the trials and deliverance of
Alma’s people, you can learn how to rely on the Lord
for strength amid your own struggles and challenges.

Mosiah 21-24

The Nephites in the land of Lehi-Nephi experience the
fulfillment of Abinadi's prophecies

Imagine that you lived in the land of Lehi-Nephi
during the reign of King Noah and had rejected the
teachings of Abinadi. Now you and your people are
in bondage to the Lamanites, just as Abinadi had
prophesied. What do you think you would do?

131
Now think of any trials or adversity that you are
currently experiencing. Read the following verses

in your scriptures, and mark what they teach about
seeking and receiving deliverance: Mosiah 21:5, 14;
22:1-2; 23:23; and 24:21.To be delivered usually means
to be set free, helped, or brought through something.

As you read the following statement by
Elder Richard G. Scott of the Quorum of
the Twelve Apostles, underline the two
sources he gives of trials and suffering we
experience in our lives: “No one wants
adversity. Trials, disappointments, sadness,
and heartache come to us from two basically different
sources. Those who transgress the laws of God will
always have those challenges. The other reason for
adversity is to accomplish the Lord’s own purposes in
out life that we may receive the refinement that comes
from testing. It is vitally important for each of us to
identify from which of these two sources come our
trials and challenges, for the corrective action is very
different” (’Trust in the Lord,” Ensign, Nov. 1995, 16).

Limhi’s people were brought into bondage because
of their disobedience, while Alma’s righteous people
experienced adversity that would refine them. Limhi’s
people were humbled and brought to God as a result
of their bondage. Studying these two accounts of
divine deliverance can help you increase your faith

to call upon the Lord for deliverance from whatever
afflictions you are experiencing.

1. Inthe chart below, the first question—How did they

come into bondage?—is answered for you. In your
scripture study journal, answer the second question: How were
they delivered?

Limhi's people Alma’s people

How did they (Mosiah 20:21— (Mosiah 23:1-4,
come into 22; 21:1-4) 19-20, 25-38;

but they were
betrayed,
captured, and
persecuted by
wicked people.

132

Limhi's people Alma’s people

(Mosiah 22:1—9,
13-14)

How were they (Mosiah 24:17-25)

delivered?

Ponder answers to the following questions about
Limhi’s people:

¢ According to Mosiah 21:6, what evidences were
there that Limhi’s group had not yet humbled
themselves and turned to the Lord? How does this
contrast with how Alma’s people responded to their
bondage? Reflecting on the experience of Limhi’s
group, what do you learn that might help you
respond appropriately to your own trials?

Even though Limhi’s people were not immediately
delivered from their afflictions, how did the Lord bless
them? (You may want to mark the phrase “prosper by
degrees” in Mosiah 21:16.) Have you ever felt that the
Lord helped you get through a trial a little at a time?

¢ How do you think the attitude of the people,
described in Mosiah 21:30—33, contributed to their
eventual deliverance?

2. Choose one of the following truths drawn from what

you have studied about the trials and deliverance of
Limhi’s people. In your scripture study journal, write a paragraph
that explains how you can apply that truth in your own life.

a. When we humble ourselves, call upon the Lord, and
repent of our sins, He will hear our prayers and ease the
burdens of our sins in His own time.

b. When we covenant to serve God and keep His
commandments, the Lord will provide a way for our
deliverance.

Think about the afflictions and deliverance of Alma’s
group as you read the following statement by Elder
Richard G. Scott: “Just when all seems to be going
right, challenges often come in multiple doses

applied simultaneously. When those trials are not
consequences of your disobedience, they are evidence
that the Lord feels you are prepared to grow more (see
Proverbs 3:11-12). He therefore gives you experiences
that stimulate growth, understanding, and compassion
which polish you for your everlasting benefit. To get
you from where you are to where He wants you to be
requires a lot of stretching, and that generally entails
discomfort and pain” (”Trust in the Lord,” 16-17).

Mark words and phrases in Mosiah 23:21—22 that show
that the Lord will try our patience and faith to help
us increase our trust in Him (see also D&C 122:5-7).

Write short answers to the following questions in your
manual:

e What do you think would have been the hardest trial
to endure if you were among Alma’s people during
the events recorded in Mosiah 23-24? Why?

¢ What can you learn from the way Alma and his
people responded to their trials? (See Mosiah
24:1-12, 15-16.)

e Though the Lord did not immediately deliver Alma’s
people, what did He initially do for them? (See
Mosiah 24:15.)

One principle we can learn from the experience of
Alma’s group is that when we submit patiently to
the will of the Lord, He will strengthen us and
deliver us from our trials in His time.

3. In your scripture study journal, explain what you think

it means to submit patiently to the will of the Lord during
a time of trial and how doing so can prepare you to receive the
strength and blessings He will provide to help you through that
difficult time.

At the beginning of this lesson, you were asked to
think of trials or adversities you are currently facing.
As you recall them, consider writing answers to the
following questions in your personal journal or on a
separate piece of paper:

e What trials am | currently dealing with in my life?

e What do I need to do to prepare myself to receive
the Lord’s power of deliverance in my life?

assignments in your scripture study journal:

Mosiah 25

Introduction

As recorded in Mosiah 25, Limhi’s people and Alma’s
followers journeyed to Zarahemla to be united safely
under King Mosiah’s rule. As these groups of Nephites
came together, they recognized the goodness of God
and His power to deliver them. They also established

a unified Church. As you study this lesson, you may
benefit from thinking about how you have seen the
goodness of God in your life and the blessings of
belonging to the true Church of Jesus Christ.

Mosiah 25:1-13

Those gathered in Zarahemla unite and become known as
Nephites

Read the following story about a young woman who
was protected by listening to the Spirit while on a hike
with herYoung Women group:

“On the way back, I was in a slower group, five girls
and our leader. They were busy taking pictures, so I
decided to go ahead. As I walked down the hill [heard
a cow [that sounded like it was dying]. A warning voice,
firm yet silent, said “Turn back.’ I almost ignored it,
but it came again. This time | listened and returned to
the group. As we started down, we saw two enormous
black bulls walking fast and angrily up the hill. The
biggest one started pawing the ground as he stared

at us... .We were scared out of our minds, but our
priesthood leader distracted it, and we were able to
climb over a fence to safety.

“As we entered camp again, I realized that if I hadn’t
listened to the warning from the Spirit, I could have
been badly hurt or even killed. I knew that Heavenly
Father cared about me personally and had kept me
safe. lam so thankful to the Lord for that warning.
This experience strengthened my testimony and gave
me a greater love for the Lord” (Marissa W., “Turn
Back,” New Era, Nov. 2010, 47).

How does hearing or reading about other people’s
experiences that illustrate the goodness and power
of God in their lives help strengthen you?

As Limhi’s people and Alma’s people united with the
people in Zarahemla, King Mosiah had their records
read to all of the people (see Mosiah 25:1-6). Search
Mosiah 25:7 for how King Mosiah’s people responded
as they listened to the accounts of God’s dealings with
these peoples.

41. For each of the four verses in Mosiah 25:8—11, record
in your scripture study journal the people’s response
when they heard the account of their brethren. For example, in
Mosiah 25:8, when they saw those who were delivered from
Lamanite bondage, the people ’ were filled with exceedingly
great joy.”
a. Mosiah 25:8
b. Mosiah 25:9
c. Mosiah 25:10

d. Mosiah 25:11

Consider writing the following principle in the margin
of your scriptures by Mosiah 25:8-11: By studying the
records of God’s dealings with others, we can feel
joy and gratitude for the goodness of God.

Think of possible sources from which you could learn
of others who have experienced the goodness of God.
These might include the scriptures, Church history,
Church magazines, general conference addresses,
your own family history records, testimony meetings,
and Sunday School and priesthood or Young Women
classes. Think of a time when you learned of God’s
goodness from these sources. Then ponder your
answers to the following questions:

e Have | had an experience where learning of God’s
goodness to others helped me feel joy or gratitude?

e What might be some long-term effects if I regularly
studied experiences of God’s goodness in His dealings
with others—whether in the scriptures or other
sources?

134

During the coming week, consider searching one

of the sources you thought of for a story of God’s
goodness that fills you with wonder, amazement, joy,
or thanks. You could write about what you learned and
how it affected you in your own personal journal. You
could also use this story in a family home evening to
teach your family about the goodness of God, or you
could share the story with your seminary class or with
a friend.

Mosiah 25:14-24

Alma establishes churches of God in all the land of the
Nephites

After Mosiah finished speaking and reading the records
to the people, Alma spoke to them. Read Mosiah 25:14—
16, and identify what Alma taught. Write answers to the
following questions in the manual:

e How is what Alma taught an appropriate summary
of the experiences of Limhi’s people as well as
Alma’s followers?

e Why do you think Alma’s words would have been
important for the people to hear after they heard the
history of Zeniff’s people?

Before reading further in Mosiah 25, think about a time
when you attended a Latter-day Saint ward or branch
other than your home ward or branch. Think about the
similarities you noticed between your home ward or
branch and the one you visited.

Read Mosiah 25:17—22, and look for how the Church
was governed among the Nephites in Alma’s day.
Reference to “churches” in Mosiah 25:21 is similar to
the way we refer to wards and branches in the Church
today. Just as in Alma’s day, God calls leaders to
direct His Church today.

In Mosiah 23:16 you learned that Alma “was their
high priest” and “the founder of their Church”
(Mosiah 23:16). President Joseph Fielding Smith
explained: “The main body of the Nephites, under
the second King Mosiah, was still intact in the land
of Zarahemla. The reference stating that Alma was
the founder of their church has reference only to

the refugees who were fleeing from the land of the
Nephites’ first inheritance. In course of time they
found their way back to the main body of the Church
and Alma was consecrated as the high priest over the
Church in all of the lands occupied by the Nephites”
(Answers to Gospel Questions, comp. Joseph Fielding
Smith Jr., 5 vols. [1957-66], 3:39-40).
2. Write short answers to each of the following
questions in your scripture study journal:

a. In what ways did the Nephite Church resemble the Church
today?

b. Why do you think it is important that the leaders were called
by Alma, who had authority from God?

c. Why is it important for leaders to teach the same truths to
all members of the Church throughout the world?

As you read Mosiah 25:23—24, look for phrases that
describe those who joined the Church of Christ that
also describe members of the Lord’s Church today.
One principle we learn from these verses is: As we
take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ and
live accordingly, the Lord will pour out His Spirit
upon us.

3. Write answers to the following questions in your
scripture study journal:
a. How do the phrases in Mosiah 25:23-24 that describe
Nephite members of the Church also apply to members of the
Church today?
b. How can remembering that you have taken upon yourself
the name of Jesus Christ make a difference in your thoughts
and the daily choices you make?

Notice in Mosiah 25:24 that “the Lord did pour out
his Spirit upon” His people. Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin
of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles emphasized the
value of the gift of the Holy Ghost for members of the
Church:

“The gift of the Holy Ghost, which is the
right to receive the Holy Ghost as a
constant companion, is obtained only on
condition of faith in Christ, repentance,
baptism by immersion, and the laying on
of hands by authorized servants endowed
with the Melchizedek Priesthood. It is a most precious
gift available only to worthy members of the Lord’s
Church.

“.. .Itis the source of testimony and spiritual gifts.
It enlightens minds, fills our souls with joy, teaches
us all things, and brings forgotten knowledge to our
remembrance. The Holy Ghost also ‘will show unto
[us] all things what [we] should do’ [2 Nephi 32:5]”
(“The Unspeakable Gift,” Ensign or Liahona, May
2003, 26).

4. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:
a. In what ways does your participation in the Church of Jesus
Christ help you to feel the Spirit?
b. What can you do to increase your faithfulness and righteous
actions so that you can feel even closer to the Spirit?

Seek for an opportunity to share with someone how
the gift of the Holy Ghost has blessed your life. The
blessings you have experienced through the Holy
Ghost can increase as you strive to be worthy of His
companionship.

Mosiah 26

Introduction

As recorded in Mosiah 26, some unbelieving Nephites of
the rising generation influenced members of the Church
with flattering words and led them to sin. Alma prayed to
find out how to judge these members according to God’s
will. The Lord revealed to Alma how to hold the Church
members accountable for their sins. The Lord also set
forth conditions for repentance. Alma learned of God’s
willingness to forgive those who truly repent.

Mosiah 26:1-6

Many of the rising generation do not believe, and they
commit sin

Take a moment to think about the following question:
Why do you think some young people do not have
testimonies or do not have strong testimonies, even
when they have listened to prophets and been taught
by their parents?

Mosiah 26 gives insight into this question. Study the
verses and answer the questions in the following chart
(write your answers in the manual):

Mosiah 26:1-2 What three things did many of the rising

generation not believe?

Mosiah 26:3 How can reading the scriptures or
listening to prophets with an attitude of

unbelief affect us?

What was one of the main reasons these
people did not have faith in the Savior
and join the Church?

Mosiah 26:4

Write one principle you learned from studying these verses:

136

The phrase “tradition of their fathers” in Mosiah 26:1
refers to gospel truths passed down from previous
generations; the phrase can sometimes also refer

to false ideas (for example, see Alma 9:16). One of
the principles taught in Mosiah 26:1-4 is: Desire

to believe and personal effort are necessary to
develop a testimony.

Read the following statement from President Henry B.
Eyring of the First Presidency, and underline what
actions are necessary to gain and maintain a testimony:

“Testimony requires the nurturing by the
prayer of faith, the hungering for the word
of God in the scriptures, and the
obedience to the truth we have received.
There is danger in neglecting prayer.
There is danger to our testimony in only
casual study and reading of the scriptures. They are
necessary nutrients for our testimony. .. .

“Feasting on the word of God, heartfelt prayer, and
obedience to the Lord’s commandments must be
applied evenly and continually for your testimony to
grow and prosper” (“A Living Testimony,” Ensign or
Liahona, May 2011, 127).

Notice that in Alma’s time, those in the rising
generation were not doing the things mentioned by
President Eyring.

1. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. In your experience, why is it important to have a believing
attitude as you pray, read the scriptures, and strive to obey the
commandments?

b. Describe an experience when faithful prayer, scripture
reading, or obedience to the commandments has strengthened
your testimony.

Consider for a moment whether you have ever seen
people without testimonies of the gospel influencing
members of the Church. Read Mosiah 26:5-6, and
look for how the unbelievers influenced those in the
Church.

As you continue your study, it may be helpful to know
the meaning of this statement from Mosiah 26:6:
“Those who committed sin, that were in the church,
should be admonished [warned and corrected] by the
church.” This means that it was necessary for rebellious
Church members to be judged according to their sins
and given the opportunity to repent.
Mosiah 26:7-39

Alma inquires how to judge those who commit sin

To prepare to study the rest of Mosiah 26, imagine you
are a bishop of a ward that includes some members
who have committed serious sins. As a bishop, you are
charged by the Lord to hold these members accountable
and help them to repent. Consider how you would treat
these members and how you could best help them.

A situation like this was difficult for Alma. Like
authorized priesthood leaders today, he had the
responsibility to help members of the Church

who had committed serious sins to repent, gain
forgiveness, and return to an active and honorable
standing in the Church. Read Mosiah 26:7-14, and
look for how Alma reacted to this situation and what
he did to receive an answer from the Lord.

2. Write in your scripture study journal why it is

important for us to know that priesthood leaders seek
and receive the Lord's guidance when helping those who have
sinned.

Remember that Alma had been a priest to the wicked
King Noah before his conversion. Read Mosiah
26:15-18, and identify what Alma and his people had

done to return to the Lord and what blessings the Lord

extended to them.

3. Read Mosiah 26:29-30. Then respond to one or both
of the following:

a. Explain why you think the following principle is essential for
everyone to understand, including anyone who may have

committed serious sin: The Lord will forgive those who
repent in the sincerity of their hearts.

b. Write your testimony of the following principle: The Lord
will forgive those who repent in the sincerity of their
hearts.

After Alma prayed for guidance about how to help
the Church members who had committed serious
sins, the Lord gave him instructions. He was to give
the members the opportunity to repent, but if they
did not repent, they were not to be numbered among
the Lord’s people. These instructions give important
insights into the principle of repentance. Read Mosiah
26:21-31, looking for insights into repentance.

4. To help you analyze what you read in these verses,
answer two or more of the following assignments in your
scripture study journal:

a. How would you summarize the Savior's words in Mosiah
26:23? Why do you think it is important for us to realize that the
Savior Himself paid for our sins?

b. What phrases in Mosiah 26:21-31 show the Savior's
confidence and trust in Alma as a priesthood leader? How could
having the help of a priesthood leader assist those who struggle
with difficult sins or temptations?

c. What do you think it means to repent “in the sincerity of
[one’s] heart”? (Mosiah 26:29).

d. Why do you think we must forgive others to receive the
Lord’s forgiveness? (see Mosiah 26:31).

In your own words, write a principle that you
discovered in Mosiah 26:21-31:

Though you may have identified a different principle,
or you may have used different words, the following
are some examples of principles taught in Mosiah
26:21-31:

¢ Bishops and branch presidents represent the
Lord in helping us repent and gain forgiveness.

¢ Confession of our sins leads to forgiveness.
(All sin must be confessed to God, and serious sins
should be confessed to a priesthood leader who can
assist with the repentance process.)

¢ We must forgive others to receive the Lord’s
forgiveness.

5. To help you analyze these principles, read the

following case studies. Select one case study and write
in your scripture study journal how the verses and principles you
have studied today may help people in the situation described:

a. A young woman has committed a serious sin, but she is
afraid to speak with her bishop.

b. A young man has a desire to repent, but he does not know how.

137
c. A young woman repeats a sin she has previously committed,
and she worries that the Lord will no longer forgive her.

d. A young man decides to repent, but he refuses to forgive
someone who has offended him.

6. Pick one of the principles identified in this lesson

and ponder how you could apply it to your own efforts
to repent. Write in your scripture study journal how you will
apply this principle.
Read Mosiah 26:37-39 to discover what happened as
Alma implemented the Lord’s counsel. The experience
of Alma and his people teaches that as we repent and
live righteously, we can also have peace and prosper.

Mosiah 27

Introduction

Mosiah 27 recounts the conversion of Alma (the son

of Alma) and the sons of King Mosiah. It tells of their
rebellious attempts to destroy the Church of God, the
visitation of an angel, Alma’s miraculous change, and
the efforts of these young men to repair the harm they
had done. The account of Alma’s conversion emphasizes
the need for all individuals to be born again and to live
in righteousness. This chapter also shows the blessings
of praying for those who choose not to follow the gospel
of Jesus Christ.

Mosiah 27:1—23

An angel calls Alma the Younger and the sons of Mosiah
to repentance

Think about those you know who do not have
testimonies of the gospel or have fallen away from the
Church. What would you do if one of them refused all
of your efforts to help him or her? Look for insights
into this question as you study today.

Read Mosiah 27:8-10, and identify how these verses
describe Alma and the sons of Mosiah. What were

138

Alma and the sons of Mosiah trying to do to the
Church and its members?

What part of the description of Alma and the sons of
Mosiah stands out most to you? Why?

At times, we may feel tempted to believe that certain
people will never change and come to the Lord. Think
about this attitude as you continue your study in
Mosiah 27.

Read Mosiah 27:11-14, and underline why the angel
came to Alma and the sons of Mosiah.

Mosiah 27:14 teaches this principle: The Lord
responds to our faithful prayers for others. You
may want to write this principle in your scriptures next
to Mosiah 27:14. Not everyone who needs to repent
and not everyone for whom we pray will receive the
visitation of an angel. The Lord responds to our faithful
prayers for others according to His own wisdom.

1. In your scripture study journal, answer one or both
of the following questions:

a. When have you felt that your prayers made a difference in
someone's life?

b. How can believing that the Lord responds to our faithful
prayers in behalf of others affect how you pray?

Ponder how you might liken the account of Alma

and the sons of Mosiah to your life. You can continue
to pray for those you know and love who choose

to act contrary to the teachings of the Lord. You can
remember that the Lord hears your prayers and
responds in His own way and time and yet allows each
person his or her agency. Also, carefully think about
the following questions: Who may be praying for your
welfare? How might the Lord want you to change?
What do you need to do for that change to occur?

Read the rest of the angel’s words to Alma, as recorded
in Mosiah 27:15-16. Remember that the angel spoke
“with a voice of thunder, which caused the earth to
shake” (Mosiah 27:11). Imagine how this experience
would affect you if you were with Alma and the sons
of Mosiah.

How would you summarize the angel’s message?

After the angel’s message, Alma could not speak. He
became weak, and he was “carried helpless” (Mosiah
27:19) to his father. When Alma’s father heard what
had happened, he “rejoiced, for he knew that it was

the power of God” (Mosiah 27:20). He assembled the
people “that they might witness what the Lord had
done for his son” (Mosiah 27:21). Alma’s father asked
the priests to fast and pray so that his son might receive
his strength and the ability to speak (see Mosiah 27:22).
The Lord answered their prayers.

Mosiah 27:24-31

Alma the Younger and the sons of Mosiah repent and are
born again

Read Mosiah 27:23-24, 28-30 to discover how Alma

the Younger changed as a result of his experience with
the angel. In the following chart, write words or phrases
from these verses that describe Alma’s spiritual condition
before and after his change of heart.

139
Before After

2. In your scripture study journal, write down one phrase
that you wrote in the After column that you hope will
describe you throughout your life. Explain why.

Review Mosiah 27:24, 28, and mark what Alma did and
what the Lord did that brought about Alma’s change
of heart.

3. In your scripture

Using Different study journal, write
Marking Techniques down why it is important to
mu understand what we must do

as we seek to change our
lives and also what the Lord
will do for us.

It can be helpful to use differ-
ent marking techniques to dif-
ferentiate between themes or
truths in the scriptures. For
example, in Mosiah 27:24, 28,
you could underline what
Alma did to bring about his
change and circle what the
Lord did. Then you would be
able to differentiate between
the two at a glance. You may
want to identify what your
markings signify in a key or
explanation written some-
where in your scriptures so.
that you will be reminded of
what they mean.

4. Answer one or

both of the following
questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. How might Mosiah 27
help people who are
discouraged and think they
cannot repent and come to
the Lord?

b. How might Mosiah 27
help people who believe that
someone else will never
repent and come to the Lord?

Read Mosiah 27:25-26,
and identify who must
be changed through the Atonement—or in other
words, who must be born of God.

These verses teach the principle: Each of us must be
born again through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.
Being born of God means that the Spirit of the Lord
causes a mighty change in a person’s heart so that he
or she has no more desire to do evil, but rather desires
to seek the things of God (see Mosiah 5:2). Alma and
the sons of Mosiah experienced a mighty change of
heart quickly, but most of us are changed through the
Atonement more gradually. Being born of God is more
of a process than an event.

140

5. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. How have you been changed through the Atonement as you
have repented and tried each day to follow the Savior?

b. What is one thing you can do to better come to the Lord and
allow the Atonement to make a difference in your life?

Mosiah 27:32—37

Alma the Younger and the sons of Mosiah travel
throughout the land, confessing their sins and
strengthening the Church

The next verses you will study in Mosiah 27 illustrate
the principle: To truly repent, a person must do
everything possible to repair the damage he or she
has done. Restitution means to do what we can to
correct the effects of our bad choices and restore what
was damaged by our actions. For example, if someone
stole an item from a neighbor, making restitution
would include returning the stolen item. Read Mosiah
27:32-37, and identify what Alma and the sons of
Mosiah did to make restitution for their sins.

Write down how someone might make restitution for
the following sins:

e Lying to a parent:

¢ Spreading gossip about another person:

¢ Cheating on a school assignment:

As you think about how you can be changed through
the Atonement, consider how you can repent and
make restitution for your sins.

with my teacher:

Mosiah 28-29

Introduction

After their conversion, the sons of Mosiah felt a strong
desire to preach the gospel to the Lamanites. King
Mosiah supported their decision, but he was then left
without a successor to his throne and a caretaker for
the scriptural records. He gave Alma (the son of Alma)
the responsibility for the records. Instead of appointing
another king, he instituted a system of judges as the
new form of government.

Mosiah 28:1-9
The sons of Mosiah desire to preach to the Lamanites
Next to each of the statements below, rate your desires
in the following areas. Use a scale of 1 to 10 (1 indicates
“no desire,” and 10 indicates an “extremely strong
desire”).

| have a sincere desire to help others find eternal happiness.

| am willing to sacrifice to help others.

| have a desire to share the gospel with others.

If you are a young man, evaluate your desire to serve a full-time
mission. (If you are a young woman, you may also choose to
evaluate your desire.)

Review Mosiah 27:8-10, and identify how Alma and
the sons of Mosiah would have rated in the above
statements before their conversion.

Now read Mosiah 28:1-3, and identify how the sons of
Mosiah changed in the areas identified above. As you
read, remember that the word perish refers to being
lost spiritually.

Write your answers to the following questions:

With whom did the sons of Mosiah want to share the
gospel?

From what you have studied in the Book of Mormon
thus far, what difficulties or dangers could the sons
of Mosiah have encountered on a mission to the
Lamanites?

Read Mosiah 28:4, and consider how you would restate
it in your own words. Notice how the conversion of
the sons of Mosiah influenced their desire to share the

gospel. In Mosiah 28:1—4 we learn the principle: As our
conversion deepens, our desire to share the gospel
increases.

Read the following statement from Elder
Dallin H. Oaks of the Quorum of the
Twelve Apostles (you may want to write
it in the margin of your scriptures next to
Mosiah 28:1-4): “The intensity of our
desire to share the gospel is a great
indicator of the extent of our personal conversion”
(“Sharing the Gospel,” Ensign, Nov. 2001, 7).

In the first sentence of Mosiah 28:4, mark how the
sons of Mosiah were influenced in their desire to
share the gospel. Notice that the Spirit of the Lord
has an important role in increasing our desire to
share the gospel.

1. Answer one of the following questions in your
scripture study journal:

a. How has your desire to share the gospel increased as you
have strengthened your testimony?

b. What experiences in your life have led you to want to share
the gospel with others?

c. If you do not feel that you have a strong desire to share the
gospel at this time, what can you do to strengthen that desire?
(Read Alma 17:2-3.)

141
Applying Gospel
Principles in
Case Studies

| \~
When you apply a gospel prin-
ciple to common situations in
life, you can better analyze the
principle and more easily rec-

ognize its relevance in your life.

The more effort you put into
sincerely responding to a case
study, the more effective it will
be in your learning process.

2. Imagine a young

man who is a member
of the Church but has little or
no desire to serve a full-time
mission. In your scripture
study journal, write a letter
to him, suggesting what he
could do to increase his
desire to share the gospel.
You may want to recall what
has deepened your
conversion to the gospel of
Jesus Christ and suggest
similar activities or
experiences for this young
man. Remember as you write

that greater conversion will lead to an increased desire to share

the gospel with others.

As you continue your study of Mosiah 28, imagine how
you would feel if someone you loved wanted to go live
among a violent people who hated those who were
not like them. Read Mosiah 28:59, and identify why
Mosiah let his sons go on such a dangerous mission.
In the book of Alma, you will learn about the “many
[who] shall believe on their words” (Mosiah 28:7)—
the thousands of Lamanites who were converted as a
result of the efforts of the sons of Mosiah.

Mosiah 28:10-20

Mosiah translates the Jaredite plates and gives all the
records he kept to Alma

The remainder of Mosiah 28 records that King Mosiah
was growing older and felt the need to select the next
caretaker of the sacred records before he died. For the
preceding two generations, the king had given the
plates to the next king. But because King Mosiah’s
sons had gone on missions, he had no son to inherit
the throne and therefore did not have a caretaker for
the records. Included in these records were the Jaredite
plates, which Mosiah translated by the power of God
(see Mosiah 28:11-19).

142

If you had to pick someone to care for sacred records,
what characteristics would you want that person to
have?

Describe how you would feel if someone selected you
to care for the plates.

Read Mosiah 28:20, and look for the name of the
person Mosiah chose to care for the plates.

3. Write in your scripture study journal what King

Mosiah’s decision teaches you about Alma’s change of
heart. (To answer this question, you may need to review Alma’s
previous actions, recorded in Mosiah 27.) Also, explain how
Mosiah’s trust in Alma might give hope to those who repent.

Mosiah 29

Mosiah's people choose a system of judges as a new form
of government

As recorded in Mosiah 29, King Mosiah proposed that
the Nephite government no longer be administered by
a king, but by a system of judges. Read and compare
Mosiah 23:7-8 and Mosiah 29:13, 16-18. According to
these scriptures, under what circumstances or conditions
is a monarchy (being governed by a king or queen) a
good form of government? Why did Mosiah counsel the
Nephites against continuing their monarchy?

Read Mosiah 29:11, 25, and circle the following
answers that indicate what Mosiah said about how
the judges were to judge the people: (a) with great
mercy, (b) according to the laws, (c) according to the
commandments of God, (d) with strictness.
Read Mosiah 29:26, 30, 33-34, 37-38, and discover
the people’s role in the new form of government King
Mosiah proposed.

4. Write in your scripture study journal why you believe
it is important for every citizen of a country to “bear his
part” in serving his or her country (Mosiah 29:34).

Alma was appointed to be the first chief judge, and he
fulfilled his role in righteousness (see Mosiah 29:41—43).

In your own words, write one principle you have
learned from Mosiah 29:

One principle this chapter teaches is: Each person has
a duty to uphold righteous laws and leaders.

5. Write in your scripture study journal one way you can
support righteous laws and leaders in your country.

INTRODUCTION TO

Alma

Why Study This Book?

By studying the book of Alma, you will learn about
Jesus Christ and the necessity of His Atonement and
Resurrection in Heavenly Father’s plan of happiness.
You will also learn about the power of the word

of God to overcome priestcraft, false doctrine, sin,
hatred, and apostasy while leading individuals to
receive a mighty change of heart and be born again.
You will be edified as you read about the missionary
efforts of the sons of Mosiah and the conversion and
subsequent faithfulness of the people of Ammon, or
Anti-Nephi-Lehies. Furthermore, as you study chapters
detailing the warfare among the Nephites and
Lamanites, you can learn principles that will guide you
in the tumultuous times in which you live and help you
prevail in your personal battles against the adversary.

Who Wrote This Book?

Mormon compiled and abridged records from the
large plates of Nephi to create the book of Alma.
The book is named for Alma, who was the son of
Alma and is often called Alma the Younger. At the
time King Mosiah instituted the reign of the judges
among the Nephites, Alma became the first chief
judge and also succeeded his father as high priest
over the Church (see Mosiah 29:42). He eventually
resigned his position as chief judge to dedicate
himself “wholly to the high priesthood” and “to
deliver the word of God to the people” throughout
all the land of the Nephites (Alma 4:20; 5:1). Mormon
used the records of Alma’s ministry (Alma 1-44) and
the writings of his sons Helaman (Alma 45-62) and
Shiblon (Alma 63) to compose the book of Alma.

When and Where Was It Written?

The original records used as sources for the book of
Alma were likely written between 91 B.c. and 52 B.c.
Mormon abridged those records sometime between
A.D. 45 and A.D. 385. Mormon did not record where
he was when he made his abridgement.

144

Alma 1—4

Introduction

Shortly after Alma became chief judge, a man named
Nehor started to teach false doctrine and introduced
priestcraft among the Nephites. He killed a righteous
man and was executed for his crime. Some years later,
Amici tried unsuccessfully to become king over the
Nephites. When the people voted to reject him as king,
he gathered his supporters—called Amlicites—to go to
battle against the Nephites. The Nephites prevailed, but
tens of thousands of people were killed. Feeling humbled
by the war, many Nephites remembered their duty, and
thousands joined the Church. However, within a year,
many members of the Church had become proud and
were persecuting others. Alma decided to give up his
duties as the chief judge and focus on bearing witness
of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

Alma 1

Church members prosper despite the spread of priestcraft
and persecution

People sometimes seek to be popular. Take a moment
to think about the possible dangers of this desire. What
happens if you care more about what your friends
think of you than what God thinks of you?

As recorded in Alma 1, a man named Nehor became
very popular among some of the people. Read Alma
1:2-6, and identify what Nehor taught and how the

people responded to it.

Search the first lines of Alma 1:12 for the word Alma
used to describe what Nehor introduced to the
Nephites. Then look at footnote 12a. Read 2 Nephi
26:29, the first cross-reference listed in the footnote,
and identify what those who commit priestcraft do

and do not do.

Using Cross-References

| \Z
The footnotes at the bottom
of each page of scripture
include cross-references to
other scriptures that can
provide more insight as you
study. Make it a frequent
practice to read the cross-
references to the scriptures
you are studying. You may
want to mark cross-references
in your footnotes that help
you better understand the
scriptures.

Priestcraft is when
people preach “false
doctrines . . . for the sake
of riches and honor”
and to “set themselves
up for a light unto the
world” (Alma 1:16;

2 Nephi 26:29). They

do not want to build up
God’s kingdom by their
preaching. Rather, they
want to receive gain
(such as wealth, social
advantage, or power over
others) and the praise
of other people. They
want to focus attention
on themselves, not on

God and His gospel. Priestcraft is a serious sin in God’s
eyes, as Alma made clear when he told Nehor, “Were
priestcraft to be enforced among this people it would
prove their entire destruction” (Alma 1:12).

As Nehor tried to “lead away the people of the
church,” a righteous man named Gideon “withstood
him, admonishing him with the words of God” (Alma
1:7). In response, Nehor drew his sword and slew
Gideon. Nehor stood trial for his crimes and was
executed. Read Alma 1:16 to discover if Nehor’s death
ended priestcraft among the Nephites.

Read Alma 1:26—27, and identify ways the Nephite
priests of God acted differently from Nehor and others

who practiced priestcrafts.

1. In your scripture study journal, write how the Nephite
priests acted. How were the actions of the Nephite priests
different from the actions of those who practiced priestcraft?

As priestcraft spread throughout the land, many people
began to persecute the faithful members of the Church.
To prepare to study the rest of Alma 1, consider how
you have seen other people tease, mock, or persecute
those who keep the commandments of God.

Read Alma 1:19-20, and look for why some people
persecuted members of the Church. Alma 1:21-31
records how Church members responded to the
persecution. Read the scripture passages below

and fill in the chart:

Alma 1:21-24 Alma 1:25, 27-31

How did other members of
the Church live despite the
persecution?

How did some members
respond to the persecutions?

What were the consequences
of their actions?

What blessings did they
receive?

Write a principle that you learned from studying this
chart:

One of the principles you could have identified is:
When we live the gospel, we can have peace in our
lives, even if we are persecuted.

2. In your scripture study journal, explain how

understanding the above gospel principle can help you
when facing persecution or pressure to disobey the
commandments. Then answer one of the following questions:

a. When have you kept the commandments despite persecution
or pressure not to do so, and what blessings did you receive?

b. How will you respond to your adversaries?

Alma 2

The Amlicites and the Lamanites join in battle against the
Nephites

Alma 2 tells about further trials for the Nephites.
Read the chapter heading to find out how a man
named Amlici and his followers opposed the
Nephites. Amlici wanted to become king over the
Nephites, but the Nephites held a vote and chose to
reject him and continue with their system of judges.
The followers of Amlici gathered together and made
him their king. Amlici commanded his followers to
go to war with the Nephites, and soon thereafter
the Lamanites joined the Amlicites in fighting the
Nephites.

Because the Nephites were faithful to the Lord, the
Lord helped them in their battles with the Amlicites
and the Lamanites. Read Alma 2:18, 28-31, 36, and
mark the words strengthen and strengthened each time
they appear. Look for how the Lord strengthened the
Nephites.

3. In your scripture study journal, write about a time
when you felt that the Lord strengthened you as you
tried to do what is right.

145
Alma 3
The Amlicites separated themselves from God

Think about the messages some people might try
to send about themselves through their choices
in clothing, hairstyles, earrings and other jewelry,
tattoos, and body piercings.

Read Alma 3:4, and identify how the Amlicites
changed their appearance.

Whom were the Amlicites “distinguished from”?

Whom did they want to look more like?

The Amlicites’ change in appearance was a
manifestation of their rebellion. As recorded in Alma 3,
Mormon reminded us of the curse and the mark that
had come upon the Lamanites hundreds of years
earlier because of their rebellion against God (see
Alma 3:6-10; see also 2 Nephi 5:20-24). The Amlicites
had voluntarily put marks on their foreheads, but these
marks served a purpose that was similar to the mark
the Lord had put on the Lamanites.

Mark the phrase in Alma 3:18 that describes the
Amlicites’ attitude toward God. Also mark in Alma
3:19 what the Amlicites brought upon themselves
because of their rebellion.

What do you learn from Alma 3:18—19 about those
who are cursed of the Lord? (Those who come out
in open rebellion against God bring a curse upon
themselves.) It is important to understand that the
curse was a state of being “cut off from the presence
of the Lord” (2 Nephi 5:20). Through their actions,
the Amlicites had separated themselves from God.

146

From the example of the Amlicites, we learn that it is
our choice to separate ourselves from God. Those who
“come out in open rebellion against God” (Alma 3:18)
cut themselves off from God, or in other words, bring a
curse upon themselves.

4. Answer the following question in your scripture study

journal: In contrast to the Amlicites, what can you do in
your life now to make sure that you do not cut yourself off from
God?

Alma 3:20-25 tells how the Nephites defeated the
Lamanites in another battle, but many people from
both sides were killed. Read Alma 3:26-27, looking for
the major lesson Mormon wanted us to learn from the
account of the Amlicites and the battles between the
Nephites and Lamanites.

Complete the following principle according to what
you read in Alma 3:26-27: We receive happiness or
misery depending on

Take a moment to think about whom you choose to
follow in your life. Reflect on the following questions:
What kinds of rewards, or wages, does Satan offer
those who follow him? (They are usually very tempting
at first, but they will ultimately result in unhappiness
and addictions.) In contrast, what wages have you
received from the Lord for choosing to follow Him?

5. Write in your scripture study journal about a time
when following the Lord has brought you happiness.

Alma 4

After a period of Church growth, Church members become
proud and Alma resigns as chief judge to call them to
repentance

Following the war with the Lamanites and Amlicites,
the Nephites were “awakened to a remembrance

of their duty,” and they “began to establish the
church more fully” (Alma 4:34). As a result, about
3,500 people joined the Church (see Alma 4:5).
Unfortunately, in the short time of a year, many of the
people in the Church began to be proud. Read Alma
4:8-12, and identify the wicked actions that occurred
because of the pride among Church members. A
principle we can learn from this scripture passage

is: If we set an unrighteous example, our actions
can hinder others from accepting the gospel. (See
Alma 4:10.)
6. In your scripture study journal, write one example of a

wicked action or attitude demonstrated by the Nephites
in Alma 4:8-12. Explain why it is important to avoid that action
or attitude as a member of the Church today.

Asa result of the wickedness in the Church, Alma
appointed another man to replace him as chief judge
so that he could dedicate all his time to his calling

as the presiding high priest over the Church and
help members overcome their pride and their sins by
“bearing down in pure testimony” (Alma 4:19). Read
Alma 4:19, and underline what Alma desired to do to
help his people.

Alma 4:19 illustrates these principles: Fulfilling our
spiritual duties may require sacrifice. The Lord’s
servants bear testimony and call sinners to repent.
Bearing pure testimony helps others draw closer
to God.

Could you imagine someone giving up a prominent
political position, such as being the president of a
country, in order to serve a mission? Alma did!

7. Write in your scripture study journal what you think

the phrase “bearing down in pure testimony” (Alma 4:19)
suggests about how Alma would teach. Also record how you
have been influenced to change or improve by hearing someone
else bear testimony of the gospel.

8. Write the following at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture study journal:

Alma 5:1—36

Introduction

When the Church was threatened by wickedness and
contention (see Alma 4:9-11), Alma knew that true
reform could only come through a mighty change in
the hearts of Church members. As the high priest of
the Church, Alma began his mission to reclaim the
people of Zarahemla by testifying of Jesus Christ and
calling on the people to repent. He encouraged them to
prepare for the judgment of the Lord by having faith in
the word of God and evaluating the spiritual condition

of their hearts. As you study the first half of Alma 5,
think about how you can apply what you learn so you
can experience or continue to experience the mighty
change of heart discussed in the chapter.

Alma 5:1-13

Alma recounts the
conversion of his father and
those who followed him

How much have you
changed since you were 8
years old? How much have
you changed since you
were 12 years old? Think
about the different ways in
which people may change,
such as in their appearance,
behavior, or attitude.
Ponder what might lead

to or bring about some of
these changes in people.
Then read Alma 5:12, and
look for what changed in
Alma the Elder. As you
study Alma 5:1-13, think

Applying What
You Learn

| \4
President Marion G. Romney
of the First Presidency taught:
“Learning the gospel from
the written word . . . is not
enough. It must also be lived.
... One cannot fully learn
the gospel without living it”
(“Records of Great Worth,”
Ensign, Sept. 1980, 4). In
several places in this lesson,
you will be encouraged to
apply what you have learned.
Applying what you learn
should be an important part
of your gospel study.

about how a person’s heart might change.

Elder Gerald N. Lund, who later served as a member
of the Seventy, taught that when the word heart is used
in the scriptures, it often refers to “the real, inward
person” (“Understanding Scriptural Symbols,” Ensign,
Oct. 1986, 25). Consider for a moment how a “mighty
change of heart” is different from the other ways in
which people may change—including the ways you
thought about as you began this lesson.

Recall that King Benjamin’s people experienced a
“mighty change” in their hearts, which caused them
to have “no more disposition to do evil, but to do
good continually” (Mosiah 5:2).You may want to write
the clarification from Elder Lund and the Mosiah 5:2
scripture reference in the margin of your scriptures

next to Alma 5:11-13.

Elder D. Todd Christofferson of the
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
explained: “You may ask, Why doesn’t
this mighty change happen more quickly
with me? You should remember that the
remarkable examples of King Benjamin’s

people, Alma, and some others in scripture are just
that—remarkable and not typical. For most of us, the
changes are more gradual and occur over time. Being

147

born again, unlike our physical birth, is more a process
than an event. And engaging in that process is the
central purpose of mortality” (“Born Again,” Ensign

or Liahona, May 2008, 78).

Read Alma 5:3-7, and look for what Alma told the
people of Zarahemla to help prepare their hearts to
change.

Answer the following question in this manual: Alma
told the people of Zarahemla about the conversion of
his father and others, as well as their deliverance from
captivity. How do you think these experiences helped
the people prepare to experience a change of heart?

Read Alma 5:10, and circle the question marks at
the end of the three questions that Alma asked the
people. Then search Alma 5:11-13, in which Alma
began to answer these questions, to find support for
this statement: When we believe in the word of
God and exercise faith in Jesus Christ, we can
experience a mighty change of heart.

Faith in the word of God leads to a mighty change

of heart because the word of God teaches us about
the Savior. The people of Alma believed in the word
of God, delivered to them by holy prophets. They
learned about the redeeming power of the Atonement
of Jesus Christ, and their hearts were changed as they
developed faith in the Savior.

1. In your scripture study journal, explain in your own

words how believing in the Atonement of Jesus Christ
leads to a mighty change of heart.

2. Write in your scripture study journal about how your

heart has been changed. If you have noticed a change
of heart as you have studied the Book of Mormon this year in
seminary, you could describe your experience as part of your
answer.

Alma 5:14-36

Alma teaches that a mighty change of heart is required
to enter the kingdom of heaven

After Alma taught that faith in the word of God helps
us begin the process of receiving a mighty change

of heart, he asked the people to consider numerous
questions. These questions can help us evaluate the
condition of our spiritual hearts—the desires and
feelings of the inward person.

Read Alma 5:14, and mark the three questions that
Alma asked the people to consider about themselves.
These three questions describe the change we
experience as we exercise faith in the redemption

148

offered through Jesus Christ. Remember from previous
lessons (see Mosiah 5 and Mosiah 27) that being “born
again” refers to the change a person experiences when
he or she accepts Jesus Christ and begins a new life
not only as His disciple but also as His son or daughter
spiritually (see Mosiah 27:25).

3. In your scripture study journal, write about how a

change of heart may be reflected in a person’s countenance.
In this context, the word countenance means the appearance of a
person's face, which reflects the person’s attitude, mood, or spiritual
state. Describe someone you know who has received the Savior's
image in his or her countenance.

In medical practice a cardiogram is a chart that doctors
use to evaluate the status of our physical hearts. It
helps identify conditions that need treatment. Study
the verses from Alma 5 that are listed at the bottom
of the spiritual cardiogram below. As you study each
verse, mark the box on the chart that best describes
how you would answer the question or questions in
each verse. (If you would like to keep your answers
more private, you may copy this chart on a separate
piece of paper or in your personal journal and then
complete it.)

When you have completed your spiritual cardiogram,
read Alma 5:21—25. Look for what Alma taught about
this truth: By experiencing a change of heart,

we prepare ourselves to receive a place in the
kingdom of heaven (the celestial kingdom).

wS. 4. Do the following in your scripture study journal:

a. Make a list of words and phrases that Alma used in
Alma 5:21—25 to describe the condition you would like to be in
now.

b. Explain how you think a change of heart prepares us to
receive a place in the kingdom of heaven.

Read Alma 5:33-36, and consider how you feel about
Alma’s message. Look for words and phrases that help
you answer the following questions:

e What is the Lord inviting me to do?

e What are the rewards for accepting this invitation?
e What do these verses teach me about the Savior?
Read the following statement by President Ezra Taft

Benson that shows how people who have had a
change of heart want to live:

“When you choose to follow Christ, you
| choose to be changed. ...

“The Lord works from the inside out.

, The world works from the outside in.
The world would take people out of

the slums. Christ takes the slums out

of people, and then they take themselves out of the
slums. The world would mold men by changing their
environment. Christ changes men, who then change
their environment.The world would shape human
behavior, but Christ can change human nature. . . .

“Men [and women] changed for Christ will be
captained by Christ. Like Paul they will be asking,
‘Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?’ (Acts 9:6.) ...

“Their will is swallowed up in His will. (See John 5:30.)

“They do always those things that please the Lord.
(See John 8:29.)

“Not only would they die for the Lord, but more
important they want to live for Him.

“Enter their homes, and the pictures on their walls, the
books on their shelves, the music in the air, their words
and acts reveal them as Christians.

“They stand as witnesses of God at all times, and in all
things, and in all places. (See Mosiah 18:9.)

“They have Christ on their minds, as they look unto
Him in every thought. (See D&C 6:36.)

“They have Christ in their hearts as their affections are
placed on Him forever. (See Alma 37:36.)

“Almost every week they partake of the sacrament

and witness anew to their Eternal Father that they are
willing to take upon them the name of His Son, always
remember Him, and keep His commandments. (See
Moro. 4:3.)” (“Born of God,” Ensign, Nov. 1985, 5-7).

To conclude this lesson, underline one idea from
President Benson’s statement that helps you think
about how you want to live as a person who is

experiencing a change of heart. Set a goal that will
help you apply what you have felt as you have studied
Alma’s teachings about experiencing a change of heart
(you may want to write it in your personal journal or
on a separate piece of paper). As you continually seek
to be born of God and experience a change of heart,
you will be prepared to enter God’s kingdom.

with my teacher:

Alma 5:37-62

Introduction

As Alma continued preaching in Zarahemla, he
warned the people that their decision to hearken

to or reject his words held certain blessings or
consequences. He encouraged them to respond to

the voice of the Good Shepherd, the Lord Jesus Christ,
who called after them and desired to bring them back
into His fold. As you study this lesson, consider how
following the voice of the Good Shepherd will help
you avoid the unclean things of the world and return
to be with God.

Alma 5:37-42, 53-62

Alma invites all to follow the Good Shepherd, who is
the Savior

In the scriptures, Jesus Christ is sometimes referred
to as the “Good Shepherd” (see John 10:11-15). Why
do you think a shepherd is a good symbol of the
Savior? President Ezra Taft Benson gave the following
description of ancient shepherds:

“Tn Jesus’ time, the Palestinian shepherd was noted
for his protection of his sheep. Unlike modern
sheepherders, the shepherd always walked ahead of
his flock. He led them. The shepherd knew each of
the sheep and usually had a name for each. The sheep
knew his voice and trusted him and would not follow
a stranger. Thus, when called, the sheep would come
to him. (See John 10:14, 16.)

“At night shepherds would bring their sheep to a
corral called a sheepfold. High walls surrounded

149
the sheepfold, and thorns were placed on top of
these walls to prevent wild animals and thieves from
climbing over.

“Sometimes, however, a wild animal driven by hunger
would leap over the walls into the midst of the sheep,
frightening them. Such a situation separated the

true shepherd—one who loved his sheep—from the
hireling—one who worked only for pay and duty.

“The true shepherd was willing to give his life for the
sheep. He would go in amongst the sheep and fight for
their welfare. The hireling, on the other hand, valued
his own personal safety above the sheep and would
usually flee from danger.

“Jesus used this common illustration of his day to
declare that He was the Good Shepherd, the True
Shepherd. Because of His love for His brothers and
sisters, He would willingly and voluntarily lay down
His life for them. (See John 10:17-18.)” (“A Call to the
Priesthood: ‘Feed My Sheep,’” Ensign, May 1983, 43).

Write short answers to the following questions in this
manual:

¢ What might happen to the sheep if they do not listen
to the shepherd?

150

e How are we like sheep, and how is the Savior like
our shepherd?

e What does it mean to be brought into His fold? (see
Alma 5:60).

In Alma 5:37, Alma described the people of Zarahemla
as sheep who had “gone astray.” Read Alma 5:37-42,
and look for what Alma taught about listening to the
voice of the Savior.

1. Write answers to the following questions in your
scripture study journal:

a. Study Alma 5:37-38, and explain in your own words what
Alma taught about the Savior's efforts to call us to follow Him.
b. In Alma 5:41, what did Alma teach about how we can tell if
we are hearkening to the voice of the Good Shepherd? What are
some “good works” that might indicate that a Latter-day Saint
youth is following the Good Shepherd?

Recognizing and following the Savior’s voice is

not always easy. Ponder the following quotation by
Elder Dallin H. Oaks of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles: “From among the chorus of voices we
hear in mortality, we must recognize the voice of the
Good Shepherd, who calls us to follow him toward
our heavenly home” (“Alternate Voices,” Ensign, May
1989, 27).

Read Alma 5:53-56, and mark attitudes and actions
that might make it difficult for someone to hearken
to the voice of the Savior.

Think of any other attitudes or actions in the world
today that make it difficult for people to hearken to the
voice of the Savior. Explain briefly why you think these
attitudes and actions make it difficult for someone to
hear the Savior’s voice:

In Alma 5:57, mark the phrase “all you that are
desirous to follow the voice of the good shepherd.”
Then mark the three other phrases in verse 57 that
tell what you can do to follow the Savior’s voice.

2. In your scripture study journal, write an example for

each of the following three statements, showing what a
Latter-day Saint youth in your school or community can do to:
(a) come out from the wicked, (b) be separate, and (c) not
touch unclean things. Then think of two righteous activities or
habits that will help youth better hearken to the voice of the
Good Shepherd. If one of these activities or habits has helped
you hear the Savior’s voice, consider writing about it in your
scripture study journal to share with your teacher or class later.
As recorded in Alma 5:58-60, Alma taught this truth:
If we follow the voice of the Lord (the Good
Shepherd), we will be gathered into His kingdom.
Mark the promises or blessings in Alma 5:58—60 that
those who receive an inheritance at the right hand of
God will receive.

3. Consider what each of these promises or blessings

you marked means to you. Then write in your scripture
study journal about why you think separating yourself from
wicked things is worth these blessings.

As you follow the Savior’s voice, you will receive
these blessings and eventually receive the blessing
of exaltation.

Alma 5:43-52

Alma tells how he gained a testimony and teaches about
repentance

Think of something you have learned through each
of your five physical senses: seeing, hearing, touching,
smelling, and tasting. Is there a way you can know
something without using one of your physical senses?
Read Alma 5:45—48, and look for what Alma said he
knew and how he knew it.

Mark in Alma 5:48 what Alma taught about Jesus
Christ. The message of Alma 5:45—48 can be
summarized in this way: We can know for ourselves,
through the Holy Ghost, that Jesus Christ is the
Redeemer of mankind.

Everyone faces challenges to their faith and testimony.
Having your own testimony of the truthfulness of the
gospel by the power of the Holy Ghost can strengthen
you during those challenging times. Remembering
your own witness of the Holy Ghost, as Alma does,
can help you stand firm in the midst of a challenge.
From Alma’s example, we can also learn that fasting
and prayer can help us feel the Spirit reconfirm the
truths and sustain our testimonies when they need to
be strengthened.

Ponder your own testimony as you read
the following quotation from Elder

M. Russell Ballard of the Quorum of the
Twelve Apostles encouraging us to seek
our own testimony of Jesus Christ:
“Individual, personal testimony of gospel
truth, particularly the divine life and mission of the
Lord Jesus Christ, is essential to our eternal life. ‘And
this is life eternal,’ said the Savior, ‘that they might
know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom
thou hast sent’ [John 17:3]. In other words, life eternal
is predicated upon our own individual, personal

knowledge of our Father in Heaven and His Holy Son.
Simply knowing about them is not enough. We must
have personal, spiritual experiences to anchor us”
(“Feasting at the Lord’s Table,” Ensign, May 1996, 80).

4. Complete one or more of the following activities in
your scripture study journal:

a. Write about a time when you heard someone bear a
powerful testimony, by the power of the Holy Ghost, that Jesus
Christ is the Redeemer of mankind. Write how you felt listening
to this testimony.

b. Read Alma 5:46, and then write in your own words how
Alma received his testimony of Jesus Christ. Think about how
you can follow Alma’s example to help strengthen your
testimony of the Savior, and write your thoughts.

c. Write about a time when you felt the Holy Ghost witness
to you that Jesus Christ is the Redeemer of the world. Write a
specific goal that will help you gain or strengthen your
testimony of the Savior, such as fasting or praying more
earnestly or studying the scriptures more intently. Work to
accomplish this goal, even if it takes "many days” (Alma 5:46).
(Completing this activity may also help you fulfill a Personal
Progress or Duty to God requirement.)

Read Alma 5:49-52, and look for what Alma taught
the people about repentance. On the lines provided,
explain why you think all people must repent in order
to live eternally with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ:

Elder Dallin H. Oaks invited us to consider several
questions that can help us apply what Alma taught
about repentance and preparing to enter God’s
kingdom:

“What if the day of His coming were
tomorrow? If we knew that we would
meet the Lord tomorrow—through our
premature death or through His
unexpected coming—what would we do
today? What confessions would we
make? What practices would we discontinue? What
accounts would we settle? What forgivenesses would
we extend? What testimonies would we bear?

“Tf we would do those things then, why not now?
Why not seek peace while peace can be obtained?”
(“Preparation for the Second Coming,” Ensign or
Liahona, May 2004, 9).

5. Think about one of Elder Oaks’s questions. In your

scripture study journal, write about why you think it is
important to live every day as if you were preparing to meet
the Lord.

151
Prayerfully consider how you can act on what you
learned today so you can be prepared to meet the
Savior and enter into His kingdom.

6. Write the following at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture study journal:

Additional questions, thoughts, and insights | would like to share
with my teacher:

Alma 6—7

Introduction

After teaching the people in Zarahemla and setting the
Church in order, Alma went to the city of Gideon. He
found the inhabitants there more faithful than those
in Zarahemla had been. Therefore, he encouraged
the people in Gideon to continually rely upon the
Lord and seek to apply His Atonement in their lives.
Alma’s testimony of Jesus Christ can help you better
understand the breadth of the Atonement of Jesus
Christ and teach you how to receive the blessings of
His Atonement daily as you continue along the path
to God’s kingdom.

Alma 6

Alma strengthens the Church in Zarahemla and goes to
preach in Gideon

Complete the following sentence: I attend church
because

As you study Alma 6, think about how understanding
the purposes of church meetings can make the
meetings more meaningful to you.

Before Alma left Zarahemla, he strengthened the
Church there. Read Alma 6:1—4, and identify two
or three phrases that describe the responsibilities
of priesthood leaders in the Church.

An important principle we learn from Alma’s
experience is this: In our day, as well as in Book of
Mormon times, the Church is established for the
welfare of all people. Read Alma 6:5—6, and mark
the following two phrases: “to hear the word of God”

152

and “join in fasting and mighty prayer in behalf of
the welfare of the souls of those who knew not God.”
These phrases identify ways in which the Church
provides opportunities for all people to grow and help
others. Think about how members of the Church in
Zarahemla might have completed the sentence you
completed above.

1. Write a few ideas in your scripture study journal about
how going to church for the reasons identified in Alma
6:5-6 could make a difference in your experience at church.

The blessings of Church membership are intended for
all of God’s children. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught:

“Everyone prays for the missionaries.

May it ever be so. In that same spirit, we
should also pray for those who are (or
who need to be) meeting the missionaries.
In Zarahemla, members were commanded
to join in fasting and mighty prayer’
[Alma 6:6] for those who had not yet joined the
Church of God. We can do the same.

“We can also pray daily for our own personal missionary
experiences. Pray that under the divine management
of such things, the missionary opportunity you want is
already being prepared in the heart of someone who
longs for and looks for what you have. ‘There are many
yet on the earth ... who are only kept from the truth
because they know not where to find it” [D&C 123:12].
Pray that they will find you! And then be alert, because
there are multitudes in your world who feel a famine in
their lives, not a famine of bread, not a thirst for water,
but of hearing the word of the Lord [see Amos 8:11]”
(“Witnesses unto Me,” Ensign, May 2001, 15).

To follow Elder Holland’s counsel, consider praying
for Heavenly Father to help you recognize and act on
missionary opportunities that are being prepared for
you. Seek opportunities to invite others to share the
blessings you enjoy as a member of the Church.

Alma 7:1-13

Alma teaches the people of Gideon about the Atonement
of Jesus Christ

Imagine that you are having a conversation about
repentance with friends who are active members of
the Church. Your friends do not think that they have
committed any major sins and wonder how they

can really experience the power of the Atonement.
Think about what you might share with these friends.
Remember these ideas as you study Alma 7:1-13.
After leaving Zarahemla, Alma talked with the people
in the city of Gideon. Read Alma 7:3-6 to see what
spiritual condition Alma hoped to find among the
people in Gideon. Then read Alma 7:17—19 to find
out whether Alma’s hopes were confirmed. On the
following lines, describe the spiritual condition of the
people of Gideon:

Read Alma 7:7-10, and look for the event Alma felt
was most important for the people to know about and
what the people needed to do to prepare for it.

2. Answer the following question in your scripture study

journal: Why do you think Alma would tell people who
already had strong faith (see Alma 7:17) that they needed to
repent in order to prepare for the coming of the Savior? (See
Romans 3:23.)

Alma taught the people of Gideon this important
principle: Jesus Christ suffered to save us from sin
and death and to help us through the challenges
of mortality. Read Alma 7:11-13, and mark in your
scriptures the conditions the Savior was willing to
“take upon” Himself for our benefit.

It may be helpful to know that infirmities are
weaknesses, inabilities, or diseases—the word covers
many types of problems. The word succor means to
help in time of need or distress. Its Latin root means
to run to someone’s aid, which conveys God’s intense
desire to help us.

Next to Alma 7:11—-13 in your scriptures or in your
scripture study journal, you may want to write the
following statement from Elder Bruce C. Hafen, who
served as a member of the Seventy: “The Atonement
is not just for sinners” (“Beauty for Ashes: The
Atonement of Jesus Christ,” Ensign, Apr. 1990, 7).
(Alma 7:11-13 is a scripture mastery passage. You may
want to mark it in a distinctive way so you can locate
it in the future.)

3. The following chart contains words from Alma 7:11-13

that describe the conditions the Savior took upon Himself.
Draw the chart in your scripture study journal, and then choose
several of these words and write examples of how you or people
you know have experienced these conditions. Think about what it
means to have Jesus Christ take these things upon Himself.

Pains

Affliction

Temptations

Sicknesses

Death

Infirmitie

Sins

Elder Jeffrey R. Holland shared the following testimony
that the Atonement can lift our burdens from us:

“Are you battling a demon of addiction—tobacco or
drugs or gambling, or the pernicious contemporary
plague of pornography? Is your marriage in trouble or
your child in danger? Are you confused with gender
identity or searching for self-esteem? Do you—or
someone you love—tface disease or depression or
death? Whatever other steps you may need to take

to resolve these concerns, come first to the gospel of
Jesus Christ. Trust in heaven’s promises. In that regard
Alma’s testimony is my testimony: ‘I do know,’ he says,
‘that whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be
supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their
afflictions’ [Alma 36:3].

“This reliance upon the merciful nature of God is at
the very center of the gospel Christ taught. I testify
that the Savior’s Atonement lifts from us not only

the burden of our sins but also the burden of our
disappointments and sorrows, our heartaches and
our despair [see Alma 7:11-12]. From the beginning,
trust in such help was to give us both a reason and a
way to improve, an incentive to lay down our burdens
and take up our salvation” (“Broken Things to Mend,”
Ensign or Liahona, May 2006, 70-71).

153
4. Write in your scripture study journal about your
feelings for Jesus Christ and what He has done for you
through the Atonement. Then respond to one or both of the
following sets of questions:
a. When has the Atonement helped you in one of the ways Alma
described in Alma 7:11-13? How did the Atonement help you
during that time?
b. How can the Savior's Atonement help you with a challenge
you currently face? What will you do to rely on the Atonement
as you face this challenge?

(2 Scripture Mastery—Alma 7:1 1-13

While Alma 7:11-13 is a long scripture mastery
passage, it contains specific words that can help you
remember the extent and power of the Atonement
throughout your life.To help you memorize these key
words, rewrite Alma 7:11—-13 on a separate sheet of
paper, leaving out the words found in the chart earlier
in this lesson. Read through your written version of
this scripture until you can fill in the missing words
without looking at your scriptures. You may want to
review these verses over the next few days to help you
remember what the Savior can do for you and others
throughout your life. Test your scripture mastery of
Alma 7:11-13 by reciting it aloud to yourself or to

a family member or friend or by writing it in your
scripture study journal.

Alma 7:14-27

Alma encourages the people to continue along the path
to the kingdom of God

Read Alma 7:19 to remember how Alma described

the spiritual condition of the people in Gideon. Alma
was teaching this important principle: By living the
principles of the gospel, we follow the path to the
kingdom of God. (The kingdom of God is the celestial
kingdom.) Search Alma 7:14-16, and underline words
and phrases that show what we need to do in order to

follow the path that will lead us to the kingdom of God.

Then search Alma 7:22-25, and underline words and
phrases showing what we need to be in order to follow
this path.

5. Draw a path in your scripture study journal from the

bottom left corner of a page to the top right corner of
the page. Write Mortality at the bottom of the path, and write
The Kingdom of God at the top of the path. Along the path,
write what you should do and what you should be that will
lead you to God's kingdom.

6. Choose one action from the path, and write about
how you have seen someone do this. Then choose one
attribute from the path, and write about how you have seen

154

someone be this. Set a goal that will help you improve in these
two areas so you can someday enter God's kingdom.

Read Alma 7:27, and look for the blessings Alma knew
the people would receive if they continued in faith and
good works. Remember that as you faithfully follow
the path that leads to the kingdom of God, you can
also receive these blessings.

Alma 8-10

Introduction

After Alma taught in Zarahemla, Gideon, and Melek
and had many people accept his message, the people
in Ammonihah rejected his message and cast him
out of their city. However, obedient to the Lord’s
command, Alma returned to Ammonihah. The Lord

prepared Amulek to receive Alma in Ammonihah and
join him in testifying to the people. Alma and Amulek
warned the people of Ammonihah that if they did not

repent, they would be destroyed. Amulek faithfully

obeyed God and used his reputation, good name, and

influence to support the prophet Alma and testify of
Jesus Christ.

Alma 8

Alma obediently returns to Ammonihah, where he
prepares Amulek to preach

After Alma taught the gospel in Zarahemla and
Gideon (see Alma 5-7), he traveled to Melek. Read
Alma 8:4—5, and identify how the people of Melek
received Alma’s teaching. (The phrase “holy order of
God” in Alma 8:4 refers to the priesthood, as you will
see in Alma 13.)

After Alma finished teaching in Melek, he traveled
to Ammonihah to preach. He had a very different
experience with the people who lived there. Study
the following pictures and scripture passages, and
then write a caption for each one, summarizing what
happened to Alma while he was in Ammonihah:

Alma 8:8-13.

Alma 8:14-16.

Alma 8:18-26.

Consider the following questions (you do not need to
write down your answers):

e The angel who appeared to Alma was the same
angel who appeared to him and the sons of Mosiah
earlier. How might the angel’s words have been
comforting to Alma (see Alma 8:15)?

e Why might it have been difficult for Alma to return
to Ammonihah (see Alma 8:16)?

Despite the difficulty of the command, Alma “returned
speedily to the land of Ammonihah” (Alma 8:18).
President Howard W. Hunter taught that the Lord
loves such obedience: “Surely the Lord loves, more
than anything else, an unwavering determination to
obey his counsel” (“Commitment to God,” Ensign,
Nov. 1982, 58).

1. Choose one or more of the following situations. Then
write in your scripture study journal how the individual
could be blessed if he or she were obedient:

a. As a young woman is leaving for school, her mother asks her
to wear a more modest shirt.

b. A new priest is challenged by his bishop or branch president
to earn his Duty to God award.

c. Two missionaries feel impressed to visit a less-active family,
in which the mother is not a member of the Church.

You may want to write the following principle in
your scriptures next to Alma 8:18-20: If we respond
quickly to the word of the Lord, He will help us
fulfill His commandments.

2. Write in your scripture study journal about a time
when you felt that the Lord helped you to be righteous
and obedient despite challenging circumstances.

Read Alma 8:27—32, looking for more ways in
which the Lord helped Alma do what he had been
commanded to do.

155
Alma 9

Alma warns the people of Ammonihah to repent and
prepare for the coming of Jesus Christ

Alma 9 records Alma’s efforts to teach the people
of Ammonihah about their need to repent and be
redeemed through the Savior, Jesus Christ. To try to
help these wicked people recognize their need to
repent, Alma called upon them to remember what
God had done for them and for their fathers.

Look in Alma 9:8-10, 13 for repetition of the words
remember and forgotten. How do you think the
inhabitants of Ammonihah would have been different
if they had remembered the things Alma spoke of?

3. Answer the following question in your scripture study

journal: Why do you think it is inportant to remember the
spiritual experiences you have had in the past? Then write about
one spiritual experience that you do not want to forget.

After calling the people in Ammonihah to repent, Alma
taught them that they should prepare for the time when
the Savior would come to earth. Read Alma 9:26-27, and
mark words and phrases that help you better understand
characteristics of the Savior. (The word equity means
fairness and justice.) What do these words and phrases
teach you about the Savior? During the coming week,
take time to think about them.

Alma 10

Amulek describes his experience with an angel and exhorts
the people to repent

Circle the statement that best describes how you woke
up this morning:

¢ [woke up on my own, without using an alarm or
being called by someone.

¢ I woke up the first time my alarm went off or the first
time I was called.

e My alarm went off several times, or | had to be called
several times before I awoke.

Read Alma 10:6, and look for how many spiritual
“wake-up calls” Amulek received while he continued
to rebel against the Lord. On the lines provided, write
your answer to this question: What do you think the
phrases “I would not hear” and “I would not know”
indicate about Amulek’s spiritual condition before the
angel came to him?

As recorded in Alma 10:2-11, Amulek described his life
before he was visited by an angel and his conversion
to the gospel. Search Alma 10:1—6 for details that help
you know more about Amulek.

156

Amulek recounted how an angel instructed him to
take Alma into his home and care for him. Read Alma
10:7-11, and look for how Amulek and others were
blessed because Amulek obeyed the angel.

Write this principle next to Alma 10:11-12: When we
hear and obey the Lord’s call, blessings come to

us and to others. There are many ways the Lord can
“call” to us—through a prompting from the Spirit;
through a feeling; through a dream; through the words
of a Church leader, teacher, or parent; through being
called to a Church position; through adversity; or
through other ways.

4. In your scripture study journal, answer the following
question: When have you felt you were blessed because
you obeyed a “call” from the Lord?

As described in the remainder of Alma 10, many of the
people in Ammonihah would not listen to Amulek’s
words. Amulek warned them that if they did not
repent, the day would come when they would be
destroyed. Read Alma 10:22-23, and identify why the
people were being saved from destruction at that time.
What do these verses teach you about the importance
of being righteous even when those around you are
not?

Alma 11

Introduction

Amulek contended with the lawyer Zeezrom, who
tried to get him to deny the true and living God. As
he defended his faith against Zeezrom’s attempts to
ensnare him, Amulek testified that salvation from sin
comes only through Jesus Christ. Amulek bore strong
testimony that all mankind will be resurrected and
judged by God. Because of the Savior’s Atonement,
you will be resurrected and one day stand before
God and give an accounting of your life on earth.

Alma 11:1-25

Amulek rejects Zeezrom’s temptation to deny the existence
of God

Think of something you possess that is so valuable to
you that you would never sell it. Think about why it is
of such great value to you. In Alma 11, while Alma and
Amulek continued teaching the people of Ammonihah,
a wicked lawyer named Zeezrom confronted Amulek
and offered him money in exchange for something that
was very valuable to Amulek. The scriptures describe
Zeezrom as “a man who was expert in the devices of
the devil” (Alma 11:21), meaning that he had learned
how to use the same strategies, plans, deceptions,

and tricks that Satan uses to lure others away from
righteousness and truth.

Search Alma 11:21—22, and discover how much money
Zeezrom offered Amulek and what he wanted Amulek
to do for it. An “onti” was the most valuable of the
Nephites’ silver coins (see Alma 11:6, 11-13). One onti
was equal to approximately one week’s wages for a
judge (see Alma 11:3).

Answer the following questions:

e When have you seen someone reject the world’s
enticements, such as the one offered to Amulek? ___

e How did seeing this inspire you to be faithful?

Read Alma 11:23-25 to see how Amulek responded to
Zeezrom’s offer. Then answer the following questions
in your manual:

e Why do you think Amulek was not interested in
Zeezrom’s offer?

¢ According to Alma 11:25, what was Zeezrom’s plan
in offering the six onties to Amulek?

¢ How is this similar to what Satan does when people
give in to his temptations?

1. Complete the following exercises in your scripture
study journal:

a. To better identify how Amulek was able to resist Zeezrom’s
offer, read Alma 11:22 and complete the following statement: “/
shall nothing which is contrary to the Spirit of
the Lord.” Then write three or four other words you could put in
the blank that would also make a true statement (consider, for
example, do, read, wear, watch, and write).

b. Write a statement based on Alma 11:22 that can help you
remember how you can overcome temptation with the help of
the Holy Ghost. What you write should convey in your own
words the truth that when we rely on the Holy Ghost, we
can overcome temptation.

Pause in your study for a moment, and ponder the
following question: How can living so I can be sensitive
to the Holy Ghost and follow His promptings help me
overcome temptation?

Read the following counsel from President Boyd K.
Packer, President of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles, to see how relying on the Holy Ghost can
help you overcome temptation:

“Tf you are slipping into things that you
should not slip into or if you are
associating with people who are pulling
you away in the wrong direction, that is
the time to assert your independence,
your agency. Listen to the voice of the
Spirit, and you will not be led astray. . . .

“, Asa servant of the Lord, I promise that you will
be protected and shielded from the attacks of the
adversary if you will heed the promptings that come
from the Holy Spirit” (“Counsel to Youth,” Ensign or
Liahona, Nov. 2011, 18).

2. To consider possible applications of what you have
learned, answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. What are some situations in which youth are tempted to
compromise their testimonies or ignore them for the things of
the world?

157
b. What suggestions could you offer to a fellow student that
would help him or her rely on the Holy Ghost when faced with
temptations of this kind?

Apply what you have learned by remembering the
example of Amulek the next time you are tempted to
compromise your beliefs or values. Remember that
you can experience greater confidence and assurance
as you live worthily and follow the promptings of the
Holy Ghost.

Alma 11:26—40

of a time when perhaps
someone opposed your
beliefs. Read Amulek and Zeezrom’s dialogue in Alma
11:26-34, and then look at how Zeezrom twisted
Amulek’s words in Alma 11:35.

Read how Amulek corrected this falsehood in Alma
11:36-37. You may want to mark footnote 34a in your
scriptures, and read Helaman 5:10-11.Then explain in
your own words the difference between being saved
“in our sins” and being saved “from our sins” (italics

added):

Read Alma 11:40, and identify the first step Amulek
said people must take to be saved from their sins.
There are some people who claim to believe in Jesus
Christ yet they don’t want to change their behavior.
To believe on the name of Jesus Christ means to have
faith in Him.

To better understand how “believing on his
name” (having faith in Jesus Christ) leads
to repentance, read the following quotation
from President Dieter F. Uchtdorf of the
First Presidency: “We need a strong faith in
Christ to be able to repent. Our faith has to
include a ‘correct idea of [God’s] character, perfections,
and attributes’ (Lectures on Faith [1985], 38). If we believe
that God knows all things, is loving, and is merciful, we
will be able to put our trust in Him for our salvation
without wavering. Faith in Christ will change our

158

thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors that are not in harmony
with God’s will” (“Point of Safe Return,” Ensign or
Liahona, May 2007, 100).

How has your faith in Jesus Christ motivated you to
change your thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors?
3. Why does a person need faith in Jesus Christ in order

to repent? Using what you have learned from Amulek and
President Uchtdorf, write in your scripture study journal how you
would explain the following principle: True faith in Jesus Christ
is a beginning to the process of redemption from our sins.

Alma 11:41-46

Amulek teaches about the resurrection and judgment of
all mankind

Before you read the conclusion of Amulek’s testimony
to Zeezrom, reflect on the following question: How
might someone’s actions be affected by not believing
in life after death?

4. Write the words Resurrection and Judgment as two

separate column headings in your scripture study journal.
Then search Alma 11:41—45, looking for as much information as
you can find about resurrection and judgment, and write what
you learn under each heading. You may want to write at the top
of the page in your scriptures or in your scripture study journal:
Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, all will be
resurrected and judged according to their works. These
verses also teach that resurrection means the reuniting of our
bodies with our spirits in their “perfect form” and “proper
frame,” never again to be divided (see Alma 11:43, 45).

5. Answer one or both of the following questions in your
scripture study journal:

a. What thoughts and feelings do you have when you think
about being resurrected and judged?

b. How does your belief that you will be resurrected and judged
affect the way you choose to live each day?

Alma 12

Introduction

Amulek’s words in Alma 11 made Zeezrom conscious of
his guilt for lying and deceiving the people. After Amulek
spoke to the people of Ammonihah, Alma stood before
them. Because the people in Ammonihah had become
wicked, Alma focused on truths that would help them

repent of the hardness of their hearts and other sins.
He emphasized the snares of Satan, the judgments that
befall the wicked, and the plan of redemption provided
through the Son of God that makes it possible for those
who repent to return to God's presence.

Alma 12:1-7
Alma exposes Zeezrom’s wicked intentions

Think of how a snare works to catch an animal: A loop
of rope is placed around a piece of food. As the animal
reaches through the loop to take the food, the snare is
tightened, and the animal is trapped.

Review how Zeezrom tried to catch Amulek in a snare in
Alma 11:21-25. After Amulek perceived Zeezrom’s intent
and responded to him, Alma stood to address Zeezrom
and the multitude who were present (see Alma 12:1-2).
Look in Alma 12:3—6 for words and phrases Alma used
to describe Zeezrom’s tactics, which Alma said came
from the devil (see Alma 12:5).

According to Alma 12:3, how was Alma able to know
Zeezrom’s plan?

What did Alma say the devil’s intentions are in Alma
12:6?

Alma taught that the Holy Ghost can help us
recognize the temptations of the adversary. In
the lesson on Alma 11, you learned that if we rely
on the Holy Ghost, we can overcome temptation.
An important aspect of overcoming temptation is
to have the Spirit help us recognize the temptation
and the harm it can cause us. We can then choose to
remain pure and faithful by avoiding the temptation.
Have you had an experience when the Holy Ghost
helped you recognize and avoid one of the devil’s
temptations?

1. In your scripture study journal, write what you can

and will do to increase your ability to recognize and
respond to the whisperings of the Holy Ghost so you can
recognize and avoid the “snares” of the adversary.

159
Alma 12:7-18
Alma teaches about the final judgment of all mankind

Think about a career you are interested in pursuing.
Estimate how much you might have to pay in tuition
(payment for instruction) at a school or training
program to gain the knowledge required to become
successful in that career.

Read the following quotation, looking for
the “tuition” Elder David A. Bednar of the
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles said must
be paid to receive spiritual knowledge:
“The spiritual understanding you and I
have been blessed to receive, and which
has been confirmed as true in our hearts, simply
cannot be given to [others].The tuition of diligence
and of learning by study and also by faith must be paid
to obtain and personally ‘own’ such knowledge. Only
in this way can what is known in the mind also be felt
in the heart” (“Watching with All Perseverance,” Ensign
or Liahona, May 2010, 43).

Look for evidence in Alma 12:7-8 that Zeezrom began to
be willing to pay the spiritual “tuition” needed to obtain
spiritual knowledge. What do you see that indicates
Zeezrom had begun to change his heart so he could
learn spiritual truths?

Look for what Alma taught Zeezrom about gaining
spiritual knowledge as you read Alma 12:9-11. It

may be helpful to know that “mysteries of God

are spiritual truths known only by revelation. God
reveals his mysteries to those who are obedient to
the gospel” (Guide to the Scriptures, “Mysteries of
God,” scriptures.Ids.org). You may want to write this
definition in your scriptures next to Alma 12:9. In Alma
12:9, Alma explained that God would grant a portion
of His word unto man according to what?

According to Alma 12:10-11, what is the relationship
between the condition of our hearts and receiving
spiritual truths?

What does it mean to “harden” your heart (see Alma
12:10-11), and how do you think such a condition is
shown in someone’s life?

Alma’s message to Zeezrom teaches the following
principle: The Lord reveals spiritual truths to us
according to the heed and diligence we give to

His words.

160

2. In your scripture study journal, write about a

commandment or counsel from the Lord that you have
been striving to follow by giving it “heed and diligence.” In what
ways has the Lord blessed you with additional guidance,
understanding, or the whisperings of His Spirit because you have
been acting on what He has taught you?

After Alma explained how we come to know spiritual

truth, he proceeded to answer the question Zeezrom

asked in Alma 12:8 about how we will be judged. Look

for what Alma taught Zeezrom in Alma 12:12-15 about

resurrection and judgment. Fill in the following blanks:

We will be held accountable before God for our
and

Ponder the following question: What difference will it
make in your daily choices if you remember that you
will be held accountable for your words, works, and
thoughts?

Mark the cross-reference in footnote 14a to the
scripture mastery passage Mosiah 4:30, and then read
or recite Mosiah 4:30.

3. Refer to what you wrote in your scripture study journal

for assignment 1 in today’s lesson—about how you could
be more sensitive to the Holy Ghost. Add your thoughts about
how understanding your personal accountability to God may
increase your desire to recognize and avoid temptation.

Alma 12:19-37

Alma explains how mankind can overcome the effects of
the Fall through the plan of redemption

A chief ruler in Ammonihah named Antionah did not
believe man could become immortal, stating that the
Fall made it impossible (see Alma 12:20-21). Search
the verses from Alma 12 listed in the following chart,
and write what Alma taught in the columns below the
headings:

Effects of the What God did What we
Fall (Alma to bring about must do to
12:22, 24) our redemption be redeemed

(Alma 12:24-25,
28-33)

(Alma 12:24, 30,
34, 37)

4. When you finish filling in the chart, answer the
following questions in your scripture study journal:

a. How does the Atonement of Jesus Christ help us overcome
the effects of the Fall?
b. According to Alma 12:24, what did Alma teach was the

purpose of life now that the Savior has made it possible to
overcome the effects of the Fall?

The term “probationary state” in Alma
12:24 is a phrase used only by Alma in the
Book of Mormon (see also Alma 42:4, 10,
13). Elder L. Tom Perry of the Quorum of
the Twelve Apostles described this
probationary time: “The main purpose

of earth life is to allow our spirits, which existed before
the world was, to be united with our bodies for a time
of great opportunity in mortality. The association of the
two together has given us the privilege of growing,
developing, and maturing as only we can with spirit

and body united. With our bodies, we pass through
a certain amount of trial in what is termed a
probationary state of our existence. This is a time

of learning and testing to prove ourselves worthy of
eternal opportunities. It is all part of a divine plan our
Father has for His children” (“Proclaim My Gospel
from Land to Land,” Ensign, May 1989, 14).

Alma testified that mortality is a time for us to
prepare to meet God. You may want to mark phrases
that teach this doctrine in Alma 12:24. Read Alma
34:32, and cross-reference it with Alma 12:24.

5. To apply what you have learned, answer one or both
of the following questions in your scripture study journal:
a. How does knowing the purpose of mortality help guide you
in your life?
b. How does your faith in the Atonement of Jesus Christ help
you in your mortal probation?

Read Alma 12:33-35, and notice the difference in
what will happen for those who repent and to those
who do not repent. It may help you better understand
these verses to know that to enter into the Lord’s

rest involves receiving a remission of our sins and
ultimately entering into the glory of the Lord’s
presence (see D&C 84:24).

Alma 13

Introduction

Alma taught the rebellious people of Ammonihah
about high priests of the Melchizedek Priesthood who
are ordained to help people repent and enter into the
rest of the Lord. He gave the example of Melchizedek,
who helped his people repent and live in peace. Alma
tried to teach the people of Ammonihah to have faith
and hope and to encourage them to change so they
could prepare to enter into the rest of the Lord.

161
Alma 13:1-12

Alma teaches the people of Ammonihah about the calling
of high priests

1. Read the following quotation, and then answer the
questions:

“In the premortal spirit world, God appointed certain spirits to
fulfill specific missions during their mortal lives. This is called
foreordination.

”“Foreordination does not guarantee that individuals will receive
certain callings or responsibilities. Such opportunities come in
this life as a result of the righteous exercise of agency, just as
foreordination came as a result of righteousness in the premortal
existence” (True to the Faith: A Gospel Reference [2004], 69).

a. What is the connection between choices made during
premortal life and foreordination?

b. How do choices made during mortal life affect
foreordination?

Although priesthood holders are discussed in Alma 13,
President Spencer W. Kimball reminded us that
sisters were also given noble callings in the premortal
existence: “Remember, in the world before we came
here, faithful women were given certain assignments
while faithful men were foreordained to certain
priesthood tasks” (“The Role of Righteous Women,”
Ensign, Nov. 1979, 102).

Elder Neal A. Maxwell of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles taught: “Premortality is not a relaxing doctrine.
For each of us, there are choices to be made, incessant
and difficult chores to be done, ironies and adversities to
be experienced, time to be well spent, talents and gifts
to be well employed. Just because we were chosen ‘there
and then,’ surely does not mean we can be indifferent

162

‘here and now.’ Whether foreordination for men, or
foredesignation for women, those called and prepared
must also prove ‘chosen and faithful.’ (See Rev. 17:14;
D&C 121:34-36.)” (“Premortality, a Glorious Reality,”
Ensign, Nov. 1985, 17).

Alma taught the brethren of Ammonihah that many
men were foreordained in the premortal life to receive
the priesthood. Read Alma 13:1, 8-9, and identify
which priesthood Alma discussed. It may be helpful
to know that in this chapter the phrase “holy order”
means the Melchizedek Priesthood, or “the Holy
Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God” (D&C
107:3). Consider marking the phrase “holy order”

as you study the rest of this chapter (see Alma 13:2,
6-7, 10-11, 16, 18). Elder Bruce R. McConkie of the
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles stated: “Nephites,
who were faithful and true in keeping the law of
Moses, had the Melchizedek Priesthood, which means
they had the fulness of the gospel” (The Promised
Messiah: The First Coming of Christ [1978], 421). This
means that the Book of Mormon prophets had the
Melchizedek Priesthood and knew how it functioned.

Search Alma 13:2-6, 10 for answers to the following
questions, and write the answers in your manual:

e¢ What characteristics did those ordained to the
Melchizedek Priesthood have? (See Alma 13:3-5, 10.)

e What were these Melchizedek Priesthood holders
ordained to do? (See Alma 13:6.)

e How have you seen this done by Melchizedek
Priesthood holders you know in your ward or
branch, and how has it blessed your life and the lives
of others?

Alma 13 contains a profound discussion about the
Melchizedek Priesthood. It teaches that men who
receive this priesthood were foreordained to receive

it (see verse 3). Those who hold this priesthood are to
teach God’s commandments to others so “that they
also might enter into his rest” (verse 6). The priesthood
is eternal (see verse 9), and it is bestowed on men “on
account of their exceeding faith and repentance, and
their righteousness before God” (verse 10). Priesthood
holders become sanctified by the Holy Ghost when
they learn to abhor (hate) sin, and thus are “made
pure and [enter] into the rest of the Lord their God”
(verse 12).
Read Alma 13:11-12, and identify the sanctifying effect
of the Atonement of Jesus Christ those priesthood
holders received because of their faith, repentance,
and righteousness.

2. Answer the following question in your scripture study

journal: What do you learn from the example of these
Melchizedek Priesthood holders about what you can do to
receive the sanctifying effect of the Atonement in your life?

3. Write the following truth in your scriptures by Alma

13:1-12 or in your scripture study journal: Men who are
members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
and exercise great faith and choose righteousness are
called to the Melchizedek Priesthood to bring others to
God. Then write in your scripture study journal about how
knowing this gospel principle can affect the way you respond
to priesthood leaders throughout your life.

Alma 13:13-20

Alma teaches about Melchizedek, a great high priest who
established peace among his people

Read Alma 13:13-18, and look for words Alma used
to describe Melchizedek and what Melchizedek did
for his people. Think about how these words describe
Melchizedek’s Christlike life. Alma taught that
Melchizedek Priesthood holders are “after the order
of the Son, the Only Begotten of the Father” (Alma
13:9; see also D&C 107:2—4), who is Jesus Christ, and
that they point us to Him by their example and their
teachings. Elder Bruce R. McConkie stated: “No doubt
there are many events in the lives of many prophets
that set those righteous persons apart as types and
shadows of their Messiah. It is wholesome and proper

to look for similitudes for Christ everywhere and to
use them repeatedly in keeping him and his laws
uppermost in our minds” (The Promised Messiah, 453).

Read Alma 13:19, and look for what this verse tells

us about Melchizedek. Look again at Alma 13:17 to
see how Alma described the people in Salem when
Melchizedek became their king. Notice how these
words could also describe the people of Ammonihah
(see Alma 8:9; 9:28). What did the people in Salem do
as a result of Melchizedek’s efforts? (See Alma 13:18.)

Notice what Melchizedek exercised, received, and
preached in Alma 13:18. Think about what you learn
about how a priesthood leader should be from the
example of Melchizedek.

4. Answer the following question in your scripture study

journal: When have you or someone you know
experienced peace after following the counsel of a righteous
priesthood leader?

Alma 13:21-31

Alma invites the people to hearken to the voice of the
Lord and enter into His rest

Look for and mark the repeated phrase “rest of the
Lord” (or a similar phrase) in Alma 13:12, 13, 16,

and 29. Alma taught the people of Ammonihah that
the Lord called men into the priesthood to help people
enter into the rest of the Lord. He used the example
of Melchizedek to show them that people who were
full of iniquity and wickedness could repent and enter
the rest of the Lord (see Alma 13:17-18; see also D&C
84:24).

President Joseph F. Smith said that entering into God’s
rest “means entering into the knowledge and love of
God, having faith in his purpose and in his plan, to
such an extent that we know we are right, and that

we are not hunting for something else, we are not
disturbed by every wind of doctrine, or by the cunning
craftiness of men who lie in wait to deceive. We know
of the doctrine that it is of God” (Teachings of Presidents
of the Church: Joseph F. Smith [1998], 56).

What would you expect someone’s behavior to be if he
or she had entered the rest of the Lord in this life as
President Joseph F. Smith described it?

Elder Bruce R. McConkie taught: “True saints enter
into the rest of the Lord while in this life, and by abiding
in the truth, they continue in that blessed state until
they rest with the Lord in heaven... .The rest of the

163
Lord, in eternity, is to inherit eternal life, to gain the
fulness of the Lord’s glory” (Mormon Doctrine, 2nd ed.
[1966], 633).

After Alma warned the people of Ammonihah to
prepare for the coming of Christ (see Alma 13:21-26),
he provided additional instruction on how to enter
the Lord’s rest. Read Alma 13:27—29 to see what those
instructions were.

Alma’s teachings can be summarized by the following
principle: As we respond humbly to the invitation
to repent, the Spirit will ultimately lead us into the
rest of the Lord.

5. Identify one of the blessings mentioned in Alma

13:27-29 that you would like to receive. After you
identify the blessing, look for counsel Alma gave that will help
you prepare to receive that blessing. Then write a goal in your
scripture study journal concerning how you will implement
Alma’s counsel so that you can enter into the Lord’s rest in this
life and in the next.

6. Write the following at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture study journal:

Alma 14-16

Introduction

After hearing Alma and Amulek preach, some of

the people in Ammonihah believed and repented,
including Zeezrom. Others were angry and caused
Alma and Amulek to be imprisoned. The wicked
people in Ammonihah cast out the men who believed
and burned their wives and children. After many days,
the Lord delivered Alma and Amulek from prison
and destroyed the wicked leaders of Ammonihah.

In Sidom, Zeezrom was suffering physically and
spiritually. He professed his faith in Jesus Christ

to Alma and was healed. In fulfillment of prophecy,

a Lamanite army destroyed the city of Ammonihah.
Alma’s prophetic guidance allowed the Nephite armies
to stop the Lamanites’ aggression. Alma, Amulek, and
many others strengthened the Church throughout the
land of the Nephites.

164

Alma 14

Alma and Amulek are imprisoned and the believers are
cast out or burned

Think of an instance when you may have seen or heard
about someone who was innocent suffer at the hands
of another person—an incident of someone being
persecuted for his or her beliefs, for example. Ponder
the following questions:

e What feelings did you have for the person who was
suffering?

¢ How did you feel toward the person inflicting the
suffering?

e Why do you think bad things sometimes happen
to innocent and righteous people?

As you read Alma 14, relate these questions to the
experiences of Alma and Amulek.

Read Alma 14:1-10, looking for who suffered and how
they suffered. Then complete the following chart:

Who Suffered? How Did They Suffer?

As recorded in Alma 14:10, what did Amulek want to
do? Read Alma 14:11, and identify a truth that might
help someone who is struggling with understanding
why the wicked are sometimes allowed to harm those
who are innocent or righteous.

One way to convey a truth from Alma 14:11 is: The
Lord permits the righteous to suffer at the hands
of the wicked so that His judgments may be just.
Note that it was revealed to Alma that those who died
were received by the Lord “in glory” (Alma 14:11).
Teaching about this event with an eternal perspective,
President Henry B. Eyring of the First Presidency said:
“Amulek was given the blessing to see the goodness
and fairness of God in even so horrible a tragedy”
(“Amulek: The Blessings of Obedience,” in Heroes
from the Book of Mormon [1995], 110).

Read Alma 60:12-13, and cross-reference it to Alma
14:10-11. We learn that among the reasons the
righteous are permitted to suffer are to seal their
testimonies with their lives (see D&C 135:3) and to
stand as witnesses against the wicked.

Understanding why God allows the righteous to
suffer can be a difficult principle for us to understand.
Reflect upon the following statement from President
Spencer W. Kimball to further understand why God
allows people to exercise their agency, even if they
make wrong choices:

“Tf we looked at mortality as the whole
of existence, then pain, sorrow, failure,
and short life would be calamity. But if
we look upon life as an eternal thing
stretching far into the premortal past
and on into the eternal post-death
future, then all happenings may be put in proper
perspective. ...

“.. Mall the righteous were protected and the
wicked destroyed, the whole program of the Father
would be annulled and the basic principle of the
gospel, free agency, would be ended. No man would
have to live by faith” (Teachings of Presidents of the
Church: Spencer W. Kimball [2006], 15).

1. In your scripture study journal, record how the truths

you learned in Alma 14:11 and President Kimball's
statement help you to understand why God sometimes allows
the righteous to suffer at the hands of the wicked.

Read Alma 14:12-13, and look for what Alma taught
Amulek to help him endure the trials they were
experiencing. Why do you think Alma was able to
respond with such confidence?

Read the following statement by Elder Richard G.
Scott of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles to help
you understand what Alma was teaching Amulek
about trusting in the Lord: “This life is an experience
in profound trust—trust in Jesus Christ, trust in His
teachings, trust in our capacity as led by the Holy Spirit
to obey those teachings for happiness now and for a
purposeful, supremely happy eternal existence. To trust

means to obey willingly without knowing the end from
the beginning (see Prov. 3:5-7). To produce fruit, your
trust in the Lord must be more powerful and enduring
than your confidence in your own personal feelings
and experience” (“Trust in the Lord,” Ensign, Nov.
1995, 17).

It may be helpful to emphasize this truth by writing
next to Alma 14:12-13 in your scriptures: When we
trust in the Lord, He strengthens us during our
trials.

2. Choose one or more of the following situations and,

in your scripture study journal, explain how the principle
you just wrote in your scriptures could help the individuals
described:

a. Several players on a young man’s sports team shun him
and openly mock or tease him about his adherence to gospel
standards. They seem to deliberately plan activities together
outside of practice that they know he will not attend because
of his convictions.

b. A young woman applies for a job at a store where a good
friend works. She does not get the job, and her friend tells her
later that the owner of the store said he would never hire a
Mormon.

c. When a young man asks a group of other young men at
school to stop using profane language around him, they push
him around and threaten to hurt him more if he tells them
again how to talk.

Read Alma 14:14-17, and think about how Alma’s and
Amulek’s faith helped them as they continued to suffer
at the hands of the wicked leaders in Ammonihah.
Why do you think giving no answer in that situation
was the best response? (See also Matthew 27:11-14.)

Alma 14:18-28 tells how Alma and Amulek suffered
many things before God delivered them and destroyed
many of the wicked leaders of Ammonihah. The phrase
“snashing their teeth” (verse 21) means striking their
teeth together in anger or rage.

3. In your scripture study journal, record which of the

things that Alma and Amulek suffered in Alma 14:18-25
would have been most difficult for you, and explain why. Then
write about a personal experience or an experience of someone
you know who was striving to live righteously but still faced
trials.

As recorded in Alma 14:25, what enabled Alma and
Amulek to stand on their feet? Read Alma 14:26-29,
and mark phrases and words that you feel best confirm
this truth: If we call upon the Lord in faith, He will
strengthen us in our afflictions and deliver us in
His way and His own time.

165
The Lord can extend His power and deliver you from
trials and afflictions in His own way and time. As we
learn to trust in the Lord’s will, we will find greater
strength and power to endure difficulties throughout
out lives.

Alma 15-16

Zeezrom is healed, a Lamanite army destroys Ammonihah,
and Alma and Amulek continue to preach to the Nephites

After leaving Ammonihah, Alma and Amulek went to
the nearby city of Sidom, where they found the believers
from Ammonihah, including Zeezrom. Read Alma
15:35 to discover Zeezrom’s condition.

Consider the following: What caused Zeezrom’s
illness? What did Zeezrom do to obtain relief and
peace?

Carefully read Alma 15:6—10, and underline two or
three phrases that show that Alma helped Zeezrom
focus on Jesus Christ and His Atonement. To
understand one way priesthood leaders can help
people receive mercy through the Atonement, read
the following experience from Elder Jay E. Jensen of
the Presidency of the Seventy:

“While serving as a bishop, I witnessed the blessings
of the Atonement in the lives of Church members who
committed serious transgressions. . . .

“A young single adult in our ward was dating a young
woman. They allowed their affections to get out of
control. He came to me for counsel and help. Based on
what was confessed and the impressions of the Spirit
to me, among other things, he was not permitted to
partake of the sacrament for a time. We met regularly
to ensure that repentance had happened, and, after an
appropriate time, | authorized him to again partake of
the sacrament.

“As I sat on the stand in that sacrament meeting,
my eyes were drawn to him as he now partook of
the sacrament worthily. I witnessed arms of mercy,
love, and safety encircling him as the healing of the
Atonement warmed his soul and lifted his load,
resulting in the promised forgiveness, peace, and
happiness” (“Arms of Safety,” Ensign or Liahona,
Nov. 2008, 49).

Bishops and other priesthood leaders can help us
receive the mercy and strength we need through the
Atonement of Jesus Christ. What evidence do you find
in Alma 15:11-12 that Zeezrom repented and received
the Lord’s mercy?

166

One principle you could write in your scriptures or
scripture study journal for Alma 15:6-12 is: Through
our faith in Jesus Christ, we can be healed and
strengthened. According to Alma 15:16, 18, how is
this principle evident in Amulek’s life?

Alma and Amulek established the Church among the
people of Sidom and then returned to Zarahemla.

In Alma 16 we read that a Lamanite army invaded the
Nephite lands and destroyed the city of Ammonihah,
fulfilling the prophecy of Alma and Amulek that if
the people did not repent they would be destroyed
(see Alma 9:12). As you read Alma 16, look for whom
the Nephites turn to for help so they can defeat the
Lamanite army. Liken this experience to your own
battles and enemies you face.

with my teacher:
Alma 17-18

Introduction

Alma 17-18 contains what Mormon wrote about the
missions of the sons of Mosiah to the Lamanites. These
accounts provide an example of how missionaries
today should prepare and serve. The sons of Mosiah
sought the Lord’s guidance as they prepared to
preach the gospel to the Lamanites. As they went
their separate ways, the Lord comforted them and
promised they would bring souls unto Him. Ammon
went to the land of Ishmael and began to teach by
serving a Lamanite king named Lamoni. King Lamoni
marveled at Ammon’s power when he defended the
king’s flocks. This service softened the hearts of the
king and his people to hear Ammon’s teachings about
God and the plan of salvation. King Lamoni believed
what Ammon taught, recognized his need for a Savior,
cried unto the Lord for mercy, and was overcome by
the Spirit.

Alma 17:1-18

The sons of Mosiah prepare to preach the gospel to the
Lamanites

Think about the length of time elders and sisters serve
on their missions today. Read Alma 17:4, and underline
the number of years the sons of Mosiah taught the
gospel among the Lamanites.

As Alma was traveling to the land of Manti, he met the
sons of Mosiah as they were returning home from their
long missions, and all of them rejoiced. Read Alma
17:2-4, and highlight words and phrases that describe
what kind of missionaries the sons of Mosiah were.

1. Review Alma 17:2—4. In your scripture study journal,
do the following:

a. List what the sons of Mosiah did to prepare to be effective
missionaries, and describe the results of their preparation.

b. Select something these missionaries did that you would like to
do better in your life, or a characteristic you would like to develop
more completely. Write a paragraph about how you can do this.

Ponder how often you pray and search the scriptures
individually and in your family, and think of the
opportunities you have to fast. In what ways have
these practices helped you become “strong in the
knowledge of the truth” (Alma 17:2)?

From the example of the sons of Mosiah, we learn this
principle: By searching the scriptures, praying, and
fasting, we can receive the Holy Ghost and teach
with power. By receiving the Holy Ghost, we can be
better prepared to share the gospel with others.

Read the following statement from Elder David A.
Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, in
which he taught young people ways they can prepare
to be missionaries. Look for specific ways that you
can prepare yourself to share the gospel as the sons
of Mosiah did.

“You can increase in your desire to serve
God (see D&C 4:3), and you can begin to
think as missionaries think, to read what
missionaries read, to pray as missionaries
pray, and to feel what missionaries feel.
You can avoid the worldly influences that
cause the Holy Ghost to withdraw, and you can grow
in confidence in recognizing and responding to
spiritual promptings. Line upon line and precept upon
precept, here a little and there a little, you can
gradually become the missionary you hope to be and
the missionary the Savior expects. . ..

“Proclaiming the gospel . . . is not simply an activity in
which we engage for a limited time or an assignment
we must complete as members of The Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints. Rather, missionary work is
a manifestation of our spiritual identity and heritage”
(“Becoming a Missionary,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov.
2005, 46-47).

Read Alma 17:9, and underline what the sons of Mosiah
prayed for as they prepared to serve. Read Alma 17:11,
and reflect upon what the Lord told them about how to
be an instrument in His hands. These verses teach the
principle: By being a good example, especially when
afflicted, the Lord can make us an instrument in His
hands.

167
2. In your scripture study journal, write about a situation

in which you feel you could be a good example. Think
about school settings, situations at home with your family or with
extended family, and social settings that are face-to-face or online.
Describe how you will show a good example in that situation.

It is harder to be a good example in some situations
than others. Look at how the Lamanites are described
in Alma 17:12-16, and think about why the sons of
Mosiah would have had a hard time teaching in this
situation.

Why do you think the sons of Mosiah were willing to
suffer afflictions in order to help a people who hated
the Nephites? To help you understand what the sons
of Mosiah hoped to accomplish, fill in the blank with a
word from Alma 17:16: The sons of Mosiah wanted the
Lamanites to be brought unto because
they wanted the Lamanites to know of the plan of
redemption.

To help you understand how to be a good example to
others, complete this assignment within the next few
days: Ask a family member or a friend to tell you how
someone’s Christlike example has made a difference in
his or her life.

Alma 17:19-39

Ammon becomes the servant of King Lamoni and
preserves his flocks

As you read Alma 17:19-39, look for how Ammon
served King Lamoni and the servants of the king.
Think about how Ammon’s service helped prepare

the Lamanites to receive the gospel. Plan to share the
story of Ammon preserving the flocks of the king with
a family member or friend. Emphasize the following
truth as you share the story: Through service, we can
help prepare others to accept the gospel. Discuss
with that person an individual whom you would like to
help become spiritually stronger. Think of how you can
serve this person, and decide how you can provide the
service.

Alma 18

Ammon’s faithfulness impresses King Lamoni, and Ammon
teaches the king the gospel

King Lamoni’s servants told him what Ammon had
done in protecting the king’s flocks. Read Alma 18:4—6,
and look for the king’s reaction to what Ammon had
done.

When the king asked his servants where Ammon was,
they told him that Ammon was fulfilling an earlier
request from the king to have his horses prepared for

168

a journey to the land of Nephi, where the king’s father
lived. Read Alma 18:12-15, and look for the effect that
Ammon’s service had on King Lamoni.

Read Alma 18:16—21, and look for evidence that the
Lord was guiding Ammon as he taught King Lamoni.
In the space provided, write how the Spirit of God
helped Ammon in this situation.

As you read Alma 18:22-32, look for specific gospel
truths that Ammon taught Lamoni. You may want to
mark them in your scriptures or write them in your
scripture study journal. As Ammon taught, he was
building on beliefs that he and Lamoni shared. Lamoni
believed in a god—whom he called the Great Spirit—
but he did not understand the true nature of God.

Read Alma 18:33-—35, and look for how Ammon
answered when the king asked him if he was sent
from God.

3. From your study of Alma 17-18, write a short paragraph
in your scripture study journal that summarizes what
Ammon was able to do among the Lamanites with God’s help.
You may want to write the following principle in your
scriptures near Alma 18:35: As we serve Heavenly
Father and Jesus Christ, They will increase our
ability to do Their work.

4. In your scripture study journal, respond to one or both
of the following questions:

a. How will the preceding principle help you in your current and
future responsibilities in the Church?

b. How can you more faithfully serve the Lord so He can
increase your ability to do His work?

Because of Ammons faithful example and service, he
was able to teach Lamoni about Heavenly Father's
plan of redemption. Remember that Lamoni was
feeling guilt for the murders he had committed (see
Alma 18:4-6). Read Alma 18:36—43, and look for how
Ammon taught the plan of redemption to Lamoni and
how Lamoni responded to these teachings.

5. Answer the following question in your scripture study
journal: Why do you think the Atonement of Jesus Christ
would be particularly important for King Lamoni to understand?

Consider how learning the doctrines of the Creation,
the Fall, and the Atonement may have helped Lamoni
recognize his need for a Savior. Elder Bruce R.
McConkie of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
taught about the importance of the Creation, the Fall,
and the Atonement:

“These three divine events—the three
pillars of eternity—are inseparably woven
together into one grand tapestry known
as the eternal plan of salvation. We view
the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ as
the center and core and heart of revealed
religion. It brings to pass the immortality and eternal
life of man. Salvation is in Christ.

“But had there been no fall, there could have been no
atonement. The fall of Adam brought temporal and
spiritual death into the world, and it is from these
deaths that man and all forms of life are ransomed
through the atonement wrought by the Lord Jesus
Christ. Adam brought mortality; Christ brought
immortality. Salvation comes because of the fall

and the atonement.

“But if the earth and man and all living things had not
been created in their physical and paradisiacal state, in
a state of deathlessness, there could have been no fall.
... Hence salvation was made available in and through
and because of the creation of the heavens and the
earth and all that in and on them are. Salvation comes
because of the creation, the fall, and the atonement;

these three are each part of one divine plan” (A New
Witness for the Articles of Faith [1985], 81-82).

From Lamoni’s experience we can learn this truth:
When we understand our need for the Savior, we
will desire to repent.

Conclude today’s lesson by pondering what you can do
that will help you remember your need for the Savior.

Alma 19-20

Introduction

As recorded in Alma 19-20, King Lamoni experienced
a mighty change of heart, which led to the conversion
of many of his people. Ammon and King Lamoni
traveled to the land of Middoni to deliver Ammon’s
imprisoned brethren. On the way, they encountered
Lamoni’s father, who was king over all the Lamanites.
Ammons bold testimony and loving protection of
Lamoni led King Lamoni’s father to soften his heart
and consent to the release of Ammon’s brethren.
Because of Ammon’s testimony and example, many
people felt the influence of the Holy Ghost and were
taught the gospel and converted.

Alma 19

King Lamoni and many of his people repent and are
baptized

Think about the outward rippling effect that occurs
when you drop a rock into a pool of water.

How can a person’s actions be like the rock that was
dropped into the water?

Write Ammon on the center point (the oval) of the
following diagram.

Read Alma 19:1, 6 to find out who was first influenced
by Ammons testimony, and write the name on the
first ring of the diagram. Choose a phrase from these
verses that you feel best describes what was happening

169
to Lamoni. Write that phrase and what you think it

means:

Search Alma 19:7-10 for the person who was next
affected by Ammon’s testimony, and label the second
ring of the diagram. According to Alma 19:10, what
was remarkable about the faith of Lamoni’s wife?

As recorded in Alma 19:11-13, how was Lamoni’s wife
affected by her husband’s testimony?

1. Read Alma 19:13-14, and answer the following

questions in your scripture study journal: What do you think
it means to be “overpowered by the Spirit,” or “overpowered with
joy”? When have you felt the influence of the Holy Ghost
powerfully in your life?

Read Alma 19:15, looking for who was next affected
by Ammon’s testimony, and label the third ring on the
diagram.

Read Alma 19:16-17 to find who was next affected,
and label the fourth ring.

Think about how all of the servants of the king were
affected by the events with Ammon, Lamoni, and
Lamoni’s wife. In Alma 19:15-17, highlight any words
and phrases demonstrating that Lamoni’s servants
were turning to God.

2. Answer the following question in your scripture study

journal: How did the spiritual experiences of Lamoni and
his household lead to Abish’s decision to share her testimony
with others after many years of “never having made it known”
(Alma 19:17)?

Read Alma 19:18-22 to see how the people who
gathered at the king’s house interpreted what they
saw. Imagine you were Abish. What would you do

next after seeing the contention among the people?
To learn what Abish did, read Alma 19:23-29.

170

Read Alma 19:30-36, and consider the effect Ammon’s
testimony had upon others. Label the fifth ring of the
diagram “many other Lamanites.”

3. Consider all of the people influenced by Ammon’s

testimony, and then complete this phrase in your scripture
study journal: By sharing my testimony and setting a
righteous example, I can. . .

Through his testimony and example, Ammon helped
Lamoni and others turn to the Lord. Consider those
who have played a significant spiritual role in your
life. Think of someone whose righteous example and
testimony have influenced you. Can you think of ways
this person has influenced other people for good as
well?

4. Consider how you might apply what you have learned
from Ammon’s example by answering the following
questions in your scripture study journal:
a. How could your family members and friends be blessed if you
followed Ammon’s example of living righteously, serving others,
and sharing your testimony?

b. How might your example and testimony cause “ripples”
beyond what you can see happening in the present moment
with family, friends, and acquaintances?

Alma 20
King Lamoni's father has a change of heart and desires
to learn about the gospel

Read the following three situations, and ponder how
you would respond:

e Ina sporting contest, a referee or umpire makes
some bad calls and seems to treat you unfairly.

e A teacher accuses you in front of the class of
cheating on a test when you did not.

e Your parents accuse you of doing something that
your brother or sister actually did.

As recorded in Alma 20, Ammon and Lamoni found
themselves in a situation in which they could have
responded with anger. Imagine being in Ammon’s or
Lamoni’s position as you study this chapter.

Read Alma 20:1-7 to see what happened when Lamoni
wanted to introduce Ammon to his father, who was
the king over all the Lamanites. Then read each of the
following groups of verses and ponder your answers to
the accompanying questions.

Alma 20:8-13 If you had been in Ammons position
and someone falsely accused you of
lying and robbing, how would you have

felt?

Alma 20:14-16 What impresses you about Lamoni’s

response to his father?

Alma 20:17-25 How did Ammon respond to the anger
of Lamoni’s father? How did Ammon

demonstrate love for Lamoni?

Read Alma 20:26-27 to see the effects of Ammon’s
response. What did Lamoni’s father desire to learn
after seeing the love Ammon showed?

What can we learn from Ammon’s response to the
anger of Lamoni’s father?

Write the following truth in your scriptures by Alma
20:26-27 or in your scripture study journal: As we act
with love, it can lead others to soften their hearts
and seek to know the truth. Consider when you might
have opportunities in your home, with your friends, or
at school to respond to other people’s anger with love.

5. Write a goal in your scripture study journal describing
how you can better respond to anger with love, as
Ammon did with the king of the Lamanites.

6. Write the following at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture study journal:

Alma 21-22

Introduction

Aaron, one of Ammon’s brothers, attempted to teach
the Amalekites and Amulonites about Jesus Christ and
the Atonement, but the people rejected him. He and
some of his companions ended up in prison in the land
of Middoni. They remained faithful during their time
of adversity. After Ammon and King Lamoni secured
their release, Aaron taught Lamoni’s father how to be
“born of God” (Alma 22:15).The king learned that by
repenting of his sins, he could come to know God and
eventually receive eternal life. The faithfulness of Aaron
and his brethren helped many Lamanites come to
know God and His way of redemption.

Alma 21:1-23

Aaron and his brethren preach the gospel despite trials
and imprisonment

Think of a time when you were trying hard to keep the
commandments and yet faced difficulties. Then ponder
the following questions: What did you do to be faithful
despite the trials you faced? As you look back on the
experience, how do you feel the Lord blessed you
during that time?

71
While Ammon was teaching King Lamoni and his
people (see Alma 17-19), Aaron and his companions
experienced tremendous adversity as they attempted
to teach in a different part of the land. For a brief
overview of the trials Aaron and his companions
suffered while in prison, read Alma 20:28-30.Then
read the passages from Alma 21:1-17 identified in the
activity below. Look for how Aaron and his brethren
handled their trials.

1. Copy the following chart in your scripture study
journal, leaving room for your comments after each
scripture:

Challenge or Diffi- How Aaron and His Compan-
culty ions Responded

Alma 21:3 Alma 21:4

Alma 21:5-6, 8 Alma 21:7, 9

Alma 21:10-11 Alma 21:11-12

Alma 21:13-14 Alma 21:15

After reading each scripture passage, in the left column of the
chart, write the challenges or difficulties that Aaron and his
companions faced. In the right column, write how Aaron and his
companions responded. Then answer the following questions:

a. Why do you think it would have been easy for them to
become discouraged, give up hope, and go back home to a
friendlier place among the Nephites?

b. How can we, as member missionaries, benefit from studying
this account?

Read Alma 21:16-17, and look for how the Lord helped
Aaron and his brethren do His work as they persisted
with faith. Through Aaron and his brethren, we learn
this principle: If we faithfully persist through

our trials, the Lord will help us do His work. You
may want to write this principle in your scriptures or
scripture study journal.

Think of what kinds of work God has for you to

do now and in the future and what challenges you
might face in trying to accomplish this work. Read

the following statement from President Thomas S.

Monson, who taught that we may have trials as we
strive to do the Lord’s work:

“To reach, to teach, to touch the precious
souls whom our Father has prepared for
His message is a monumental task.
Success is rarely simple. Generally it is
preceded by tears, trials, trust, and
testimony. . . .

172

“.. Servants of God take comfort from the Master’s
assurance: ‘I am with you alway’ (Matthew 28:20). This
magnificent promise sustains you... . It comforts you
during those moments of discouragement, which come
to all” (“Tears, Trials, Trust, Testimony,” Ensign, May
1987, 43).

2. In your scripture study journal, write about an experience

when you faithfully persisted through trials. Or you could
write about how you plan to be faithful in a present challenge, using
the principles in this lesson. Also, write about a few future situations
when you think you might need to persist through trials when doing
the Lord's work.

Read Alma 21:18—23 to see what Ammon did after
helping Aaron and his brethren be released from
prison. Look for how the Lamanites’ lives were
changed because Ammon taught them the gospel.

Think about how the gospel of Jesus Christ has
changed the life of someone you know. Ponder how
you could share the gospel with someone you know,
or think about someone who could be influenced
by the example of Aaron and his brethren. Consider
sharing with that individual what you have learned
from the example of Aaron and his brethren as they
faithfully persisted in the Lord’s work.

Alma 22

Lamoni'’s father, who is king over all the land, believes the
gospel as taught by Aaron

Recall Ammon’s encounter with Lamoni’s father, which
was reviewed in the previous lesson. Reread the king’s
specific request to Ammon, recorded in Alma 20:27. As
you read Alma 22:1—3, look for how the king responded
to Aaron’s visit.

Read Alma 22:4—6, and find what troubled King
Lamoni’s father. Search Alma 22:7-14 for the truths
that Aaron taught Lamoni’s father.

Reflect upon the following questions (it may be helpful
to remember the similar discussion about King Lamoni
in Alma 17-18):

e Why did the king need to believe in God in order to
understand repentance?

¢ How did knowing about the Fall help the king
understand repentance?

3. Answer the following question in your scripture study

journal: Why is it essential to understand the Fall of Adam
and the Atonement of Jesus Christ in order to understand
repentance?

Search Alma 22:15, looking for what the father of
King Lamoni was willing to give up in order to receive
joy and eternal life, and consider marking it in your
scriptures.

4. Answer the following question in your scripture study

journal: Why do you think the attitude King Lamoni’s father
had is important for everyone to have who desires to come to
know God?

Read Alma 22:16 to see how Aaron answered the king’s
question about how to receive eternal life. (Consider
marking important truths you see being taught in this
verse.) How can accepting and living the truths Aaron
taught lead a person to receive eternal life?

Read Alma 22:17-18, looking for how the king
responded to Aaron’s instructions. Ponder the
following question: What can we learn about being
born of God from King Lamoni’s father?

You may want to mark this phrase in Alma 22:18: “I
will give away all my sins to know thee.” Ponder the
following truth, and write it in your scriptures or in
your scripture study journal: We must be willing
to forsake all our sins in order to be spiritually
changed and born of God.

Read the following statement by Elder
Dallin H. Oaks of the Quorum of the
Twelve Apostles: “The gospel of Jesus
Christ challenges us to change. ‘Repent’
is its most frequent message, and
repenting means giving up all of our
practices—personal, family, ethnic, and national—
that are contrary to the commandments of God. The
purpose of the gospel is to transform common
creatures into celestial citizens, and that requires
change” (“Repentance and Change,” Ensign or
Liahona, Nov. 2003, 37).

Ponder what you need to do in your life now to be
spiritually changed.

Read Alma 22:19—22 to see what events followed the
king’s prayer. Read Alma 22:23—27, looking to see what
Lamoni's father did because he had received a change
of heart and had obtained the Spirit of the Lord for
himself.

5. In your scripture study journal, write what you have

learned about being born again from studying about
King Lamoni’s father. Explain how you think his example could
help youth today make changes in their lives to help them be
born of God.

6. Write the following at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture study journal:

Alma 23-24

Introduction

Following his conversion, the king of the Lamanites
proclaimed religious liberty among his people. This
proclamation allowed Aaron and his brethren to
preach the gospel and establish churches in many
Lamanite cities. Thousands of Lamanites were
converted and never fell away. Those Lamanites
who were converted to the Lord made a covenant
to lay down their weapons of war. They took upon
themselves the name of Anti-Nephi-Lehies. When
the unconverted Lamanites attacked them, many of
the Anti-Nephi-Lehies sacrificed their lives rather
than break their covenant.

Alma 23

Thousands of Lamanites are converted to the Lord and
change their name to Anti-Nephi-Lehies

1. In your scripture study journal, draw a picture of a

happy face and a sad face. Label the happy face Faithful
and the sad face inconsistent. As you read the following
statement from Elder Richard G. Scott of the Quorum of the
Twelve Apostles, look for words or phrases that describe these
two different types of people. Write these words or phrases
under the appropriate picture.

“Fach of us has observed how some
individuals go through life consistently
doing the right things. They seem happy,
even enthusiastic about life. When
difficult choices are to be made, they seem
to invariably make the right ones, even
though there were enticing alternatives available to
them. We know that they are subject to temptation, but
they seem oblivious to it. Likewise, we have observed
how others are not so valiant in the decisions they
make. In a powerfully spiritual environment, they
resolve to do better, to change their course of life, to set
aside debilitating habits. They are very sincere in their
determination to change, yet they are soon back doing
the same things they resolved to abandon.

173
“What is it that makes the difference in the lives of
these two groups? How can you consistently make the
right choices?” (“Full Conversion Brings Happiness,”
Ensign, May 2002, 24).

Ponder how you would answer the two questions that
Elder Scott asked. As you study Alma 23-24, think about
why many members of the Church remain faithful to
the gospel of Jesus Christ throughout their lives.

After the king of the Lamanites became converted
to the gospel of Jesus Christ, he sent a proclamation
among all his people, and a miracle occurred.
Thousands of Lamanites were also converted. Read
Alma 23:1—-5 to see what the proclamation was and
how the miracle occurred.

Read Alma 23:6—7. How many of the thousands who
were “converted unto the Lord” remained converted
throughout their lives?

After these Lamanites were converted, they wanted
to be called by a new name so they would no longer
be known as Lamanites. Read Alma 23:16-18, and
identify the name they chose and the blessings that
came to them because of their faithfulness.

2. In your scripture study journal, under the figure

labeled “Faithful,” write what you have learned from the
Anti-Nephi-Lehies about being faithful to the Lord throughout
your life.

Write the following truth in your scriptures or scripture
study journal: Conversion means spiritually changing
and becoming a new person through the power of
God. Just as the Anti-Nephi-Lehies changed, if you are
willing to receive the power of the Atonement in your
life by your faith and repentance, you can become a new
person through the power of God and remain converted
throughout your life.

Look again at Elder Scott’s two questions, and then
read his answer: “True conversion is the fruit of faith,
repentance, and consistent obedience. . . . True conversion
will strengthen your capacity to do what you know
you should do, when you should do it, regardless

of the circumstances” (“Full Conversion Brings
Happiness,” 25).

3. Answer the following question in your scripture study

journal: According to Alma 23:18, the converted Lamanites
began to be industrious and friendly with the Nephites. When people
are trying to repent and change their lives, why is it important for
them to associate with others who are also striving to live
righteously?

174

\"

4. Examine the terms you have listed under the ’Faithfu

figure in your scripture study journal. Think about how
well these terms define your level of conversion. Write in your
scripture study journal what you will do to become more fully
converted to the Lord.

Alma 24

The Anti-Nephi-Lehies covenant never to take up weapons
again

As recorded in Alma 24:3, the king of the
Lamanites conferred the kingdom upon his son
just before his death, and he gave his son the name
Anti-Nephi-Lehi. Read Alma 24:1-5 to see what
problem soon developed that led Ammon and his
brethren to hold a council with the king. When it
became known that the unconverted Lamanites
were going to war against the Anti-Nephi-Lehies,
these righteous people decided they would make
no preparations to defend themselves (see Alma
24:6 ). Read Alma 24:7-14, and identify why the
Anti-Nephi-Lehies made this decision.

5. In your scripture study journal, write what you learn
from the Anti-Nephi-Lehies about what it means to
forsake our sins when we repent.

Read Alma 24:15-18, looking for what the
Anti-Nephi-Lehies did to show the Lord they had
truly repented. Why did the people bury their swords
and other weapons deep in the ground? (See Alma
24:17-18.)

In our own lives when we repent of sins,
we should strive never to commit those
sins again. Read what President
Spencer W. Kimball taught about
abandoning sin as an important aspect
of repentance: “In abandoning sin one
cannot merely wish for better conditions. He must
make them... .He must be certain not only that he
has abandoned the sin but that he has changed the
situations surrounding the sin. He should avoid the
places and conditions and circumstances where the
sin occurred, for these could most readily breed it
again. He must abandon the people with whom the
sin was committed. He may not hate the persons
involved but he must avoid them and everything
associated with the sin. He must . . . build a new life.
He must eliminate anything which would stir the old
memories” (The Miracle of Forgiveness [1969], 171-72).

In Alma 24:10-12, mark words or phrases showing

the repentance of the Anti-Nephi-Lehies and God’s
forgiveness of their sins. Write the following principle
in the margin next to these verses: If we do all we
can to repent, God will take away our guilt and
help us remain clean. Refer to the account of the
Anti-Nephi-Lehies burying their weapons in the earth.
In our day, we still need to “bury” our sins to show the
Lord that we are doing all we can to repent and not
commit the same sins again.

6. Consider how people in the following situations might
ensure they would not commit the same sins again. Write
your suggestions for each situation in your scripture study
journal:
a. Someone watched a pornographic scene in a movie because
friends encouraged the person to watch the movie with them.
b. Someone secretly broke the Word of Wisdom with friends
when a group went out together at night.
c. Someone shared answers from a completed exam with a
friend who was preparing to take the same test later that day.

Ponder the following question: What do you need
to “bury” in your life so that you are not tempted to
commit sins you have repented of?

Read Alma 24:19-22 to see what the Anti-Nephi-Lehies
did when the Lamanites came to battle against them.
These people showed their devotion to the Lord by

being willing to die rather than break a promise they had
made to the Lord. They had given their lives completely
to the Lord, and they remained completely faithful to
Him throughout their lives.

Read what President Ezra Taft Benson taught about
giving our lives to the Lord:

“Men changed for Christ will be captained

by Christ. Like Paul they will be asking,

‘Lord, what wilt thou have me do?’ (Acts
9:6.) ...

“Their will is swallowed up in His will.
(See John 5:30.)

“They do always those things that please the Lord.
(See John 8:29.)

“Not only would they die for the Lord, but more
important they want to live for Him.

“Enter their homes, and the pictures on their walls, the
books on their shelves, the music in the air, their words
and acts reveal them as Christians.

“They stand as witnesses of God at all times, and in all
things, and in all places. (See Mosiah 18:9.)

“They have Christ on their minds, as they look unto
Him in every thought. (See D&C 6:36.)

“They have Christ in their hearts as their affections are
placed on Him forever. (See Alma 37:36.)” (“Born of
God,” Ensign, Nov. 1985, 6-7).

7. Answer the following question in your scripture study
journal: During this week, what are some ways you can
show that you have given your life completely to the Lord?

Read Alma 24:23-27, which describes the Lamanites’
reaction when they saw that the Anti-Nephi-Lehies
were not going to fight. As you read, find words or
phrases that teach this principle: By being faithful
to the Lord, we can help others become converted.
Think about how specific members of your family or

certain friends could be influenced by your decision to
be faithful to the Lord.

Alma 25-29

Introduction

After years of preaching the gospel, Ammon praised
the Lord and expressed gratitude for the blessing

of being an instrument in His hands to bring the
gospel to the Lamanites. Many Lamanites began to
believe in the Lord, repented, and called themselves

the Anti-Nephi-Lehies. After the Anti- Nephi-Lehies

made a covenant with God to never again take up

weapons of war, the Amalekites and Lamanites began

to make preparations to go to battle against them.
To help them keep their covenant with the Lord, the
Anti-Nephi-Lehies accepted an offer of protection
from the Nephites. The Nephite prophet Alma
expressed the joy he felt from preaching the gospel
and inviting others to come unto Jesus Christ.

Alma 25

Abinadi’s prophecy is fulfilled, and many Lamanites are
converted

Think about any changes you have made as you
have become more converted to the gospel of Jesus
Christ. Alma 25 tells of the fulfillment of Abinadi’s
prophecy that descendants of the priests of Noah
would be hunted down and killed and shows that
the Lord vindicates His prophets and fulfills their
inspired prophecies (see Alma 25:9). It also tells
how many Lamanites repented and joined the
Anti-Nephi-Lehies. Read Alma 25:14, and identify
what these Lamanites did as they became converted
to the gospel. In Alma 25:15 we learn two reasons
why they kept the law of Moses.

Alma 26

Ammon rejoices in the Lord's mercies toward the
Lamanites and the sons of Mosiah

What does it take to build a house or a church?
What type of church could a skilled craftsman build
with the right tools or instruments? In Alma 26,
Ammon described himself and his brothers as being
instruments in the hands of God to do a great work.
Read Alma 26:1-5, 12-13, and identify what the Lord
accomplished by using Ammon and his brothers as
instruments in His hands. (You may want to mark
the answers you find in your scriptures.) In verse 5
the phrase “thrust in the sickle” means to work hard,
“sheaves” represent converts, “garners” represent the

176

Church, and the phrase that those who are gathered
“are not wasted” refers to God preserving the converts
and granting them eternal life.

Identify or mark one or more phrases in Alma 26:12
that indicates that Ammon understood he was only a
tool in the Lord’s hands and that it was the Lord who
accomplished the miracles during his mission.

From these verses we learn this principle: As we
prepare and humble ourselves, the Lord strengthens
us and uses us as an instrument in His hands. A
companion principle we also learn in Alma 26 is: We
experience joy as we faithfully serve the Lord and
His children. Read Alma 26:11, 13, 16, and mark each
time you see the word joy or rejoice.

Read Alma 26:13-16, and identify reasons Ammon
gave for his rejoicing.

1. In your scripture study journal, write why you think we

experience joy when we are in the Lord’s service. You may
also want to write about a time when you felt joy as a result of
your service in the Church.

Read the following verses, and think about the
answers to their accompanying questions:

Alma 26:22-23, 26-29. Note the requirements that are
listed to know the mysteries of God. What promise is
given to missionaries who have these qualifications?
What obstacles did Ammon and his brothers face in
their service to the Lord and the Lamanites? Which

of these obstacles are similar to obstacles faced by
those who serve the Lord today? What could modern
missionaries learn from Alma 26:29 about where they
should teach the gospel?

Alma 26:30. What encouraged the sons of Mosiah to
continue to serve even during difficult times?
2. Read Alma 26:35-37, and answer the following
questions in your scripture study journal:
a. What truths taught in these verses would give you reasons to
rejoice in the goodness of God? (You may want to mark phrases
that indicate these truths.)
b. What difference does it make to know that God is mindful
of you?

Alma 27

Ammon leads the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi to safety
among the Nephites

As you prepare to study Alma 27, think about answers
to the following questions:

e Have you ever had someone make a promise to you
and then break that promise?

e Do you know anyone who has always kept his or
her promises to you?

¢ How do you feel toward people who keep their
promises? Why?

Following their unsuccessful efforts to destroy the
Nephites, the Lamanites attempted to destroy those
Lamanites (the Anti-Nephi-Lehies) who had been
converted by Ammon and his brothers. Remember
that the Anti-Nephi-Lehies buried their weapons
of war to show that they would keep their covenant
to never kill again. To find out how committed the
Anti-Nephi-Lehies were to keeping that covenant,
read Alma 27:2-3.

Imagine the strength of the commitment of the
Anti-Nephi-Lehies to honor their covenant to not take
up weapons when they were being attacked. Consider
how you can strengthen your commitment to keep
your covenants with Heavenly Father when it seems
difficult to do so.

Because of persecution and attacks from wicked
Lamanites, Ammon led the Anti-Nephi-Lehies to
Zarahemla—a Nephite city—where the Nephites
promised to protect them from their enemies. Consider
what you could do to help those around you keep the
covenants they have made with the Lord.

Once in Zarahemla, the Anti-Nephi-Lehies were
called the people of Ammon by the Nephites. Read
Alma 27:27-30, looking for what the people of
Ammon became known for. Mark any words or
phrases that teach the following principle: When
we are fully converted to the Lord, we keep the
covenants we have made with Him.

3. Answer one or both of the following questions in your
scripture study journal:

a. What experiences have you had when it was difficult for you
to keep your covenants with the Lord, but you still kept them?

b. Who has been an example to you of someone who is faithful
and true to his or her covenants with the Lord? How has that
person demonstrated faithfulness to those covenants?

Alma 28
The Nephites defeat the Lamanites in a great battle

4. Imagine you are a reporter assigned to cover the events
found in Alma 28. Read Alma 28:1—6, 11-14, and write a
short paragraph in your scripture study journal summarizing what
happened. Be sure to answer the following questions in your
paragraph.
a. What price did the Nephites pay for helping the people of
Ammon keep their covenants? (See Alma 28:1-3.)

b. How much did these deaths affect the Nephites? (See Alma
28:4-6.)

c. Why were some people afraid when their loved ones died
while others rejoiced and were hopeful? (See Alma 28:1 1-12.)

Write a principle statement to summarize what you
learned from Alma 28:11-12:

One of the principles taught in Alma 28 is: When we
have faith in Jesus Christ and His promises, we can
have hope and joy despite death.

5. Answer one or both of the following questions in your
scripture study journal:

a. When have you witnessed someone face his or her own
death or the death of a loved one with hope because of faith in
Jesus Christ?

b. How would you explain death to someone in order to help
that person have hope after the death of a loved one?

177
Identify Mormon’s three “and thus we see” statements
in Alma 28:13-14. You may want to mark these in your
scriptures. What points does Mormon emphasize as
he concludes the account of the mission of the sons of
Mosiah to the Lamanites? Ponder why these truths are
important for you to know.

Alma 29
Alma glories in bringing souls unto God

Have you ever wished you had the power to
singlehandedly bring about some great good or stop
some terrible evil in the world? Alma 29 contains

Alma’s expression of his desire to be an instrument in
the Lord’s hands. Search Alma 29:1—3, and look for the
desire of Alma’s heart.

Remembering what had happened to Alma as a young
man, consider why Alma might have had the desire he
expressed. Notice in Alma 29:3 why he felt that he was
sinning in his desire. Read Alma 29:4—5, and identify
what the Lord grants to those who have righteous
desires.

178

Search Alma 29:10, 14-16, and mark the reward Alma
received for bringing souls to Christ. You may want to
mark each time Alma uses the word joy in these verses.

One principle taught in Alma 29 is: We will
experience joy as we help others to repent and
come unto Jesus Christ. What experiences have you
had that have helped you to feel joy in helping others
come unto Christ?

Ponder for a moment ways you might help
individuals in the following groups of people make
needed changes in their lives and come unto Jesus
Christ: (a) your friends, (b) members of your family,
and (c) those you do not yet know well. Seek the
guidance of the Spirit as you look for opportunities
to bring others to Jesus Christ.

Alma 30

Introduction

Following a great battle with the Lamanites, peace
settled over the land of Zarahemla. In the midst of this
period of peace, aman named Korihor began to preach
that there would be no Christ. His false teachings led
those who believed him to sin. He spoke against the
leaders of the Church, claiming they were teaching
“foolish traditions” (Alma 30:27). Korihor was brought
before Alma, who taught him that all things testify of
Christ. Eventually, Korihor confessed that his actions
were guided by the devil.

Alma 30:1-29
Korihor, an anti-Christ, ridicules the doctrine of Christ

Imagine that someone prepared a meal for you. It
looked and smelled delicious, but when you ate it, you
became extremely sick. Think for a moment how false
teachings might be similar to being offered food that
looks delicious but is secretly poisonous.
Previously you studied about the anti-Christs Sherem
(see Jacob 7) and Nehor (see Alma 1). Remember that
one definition of anti-Christ is “anyone or anything
that counterfeits the true gospel plan of salvation

and that openly or secretly opposes Christ” (Guide

to the Scriptures, “Antichrist,” scriptures.lds.org).
Today you will learn about another man who was an
enemy of Christ and whose false teachings deceived
others and led them to sin. Many in the world today
use arguments similar to Korihor’s against those who
express a belief in God.

Korihor began to preach among the Nephites. Read
Alma 30:6, 12, and look for phrases that indicate
Korihor was an anti-Christ.

Read Alma 30:12-18, and match the false teachings
of Korihor with their implications.

Some False Teachings | Possible Interpretations and
of Korihor, an Anti- Implications of the False Teach-
Christ ings

___1. Alma 30:13-14 | A. Unless you have physical
evidence of religious truths,
you should not believe in Jesus
Christ or His gospel. There
is no such thing as personal
revelation through the Holy

Ghost.

2. Alma 30:15 B. There is no such thing as sin.
There is no universal standard
of what is right or wrong.

3. Alma 30:16 C. People prosper by their own
efforts alone. There is no need
for God in the affairs of man.

___ 4. Alma 30:17 D. The words of the prophets
(“every man and scriptures are not true, so
fared... .”) you should not believe their

prophecies.

___ 5. Alma 30:17 E. There is no such thing as

("whatsoever a remission of sins. There is no

man did. ..”) need to seek help through the
Atonement because there is no
such thing as an Atonement.
6. Alma 30:18 F. There is no life after death, so

there is no need to worry about
a judgment after this life.

(The answers to this matching exercise are found at the
end of this lesson.)

Alma 30:18 teaches the principle: Satan uses false
doctrines to entice us to commit sin.

President Boyd K. Packer, President of the Quorum
of the Twelve Apostles, taught:

“Our behavior is not totally controlled by
natural impulses. Behavior begins with
belief as well.

“Beliefs are born of philosophies, or
doctrines. Doctrines can be spiritual or
secular, wholesome or destructive, true or false... .

“True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and
behavior” (“Little Children,” Ensign, Nov. 1986, 17).

1. Choose two or more of the false teachings of Korihor

listed in the matching exercise chart. In your scripture
study journal, write what the true doctrines are and tell how
knowing the truth affects your attitudes and behavior.

After his success in the land of Zarahemla, Korihor
went to the land of Jershon to preach to the people
of Ammon. Read Alma 30:19-20, and find out if they
accepted his false teachings.

The people of Ammon “were more wise than many of
the Nephites” and “caused that he should be carried
out of the land” (Alma 30:20-21). From what you have
learned about the people of Ammon, why do you think
they did not believe Korihor’s false teachings?

Alma 30:21-29 tells how Korihor then went to the land
of Gideon, “and here he did not have much success”
(Alma 30:21). Some of Korihor’s arguments against the
Church and its teachings are found in Alma 30:24, 27,
two of which are: (1) those who believe in God are in
bondage and (2) religion takes away freedoms. These
arguments are still used by opponents to religion
today.

President Henry B. Eyring of the First Presidency
taught that our belief in God gives us freedom:
“Korihor was arguing, as men and women have
falsely argued from the beginning of time, that to
take counsel from the servants of God is to surrender
God-given rights of independence. But the argument
is false because it misrepresents reality. When we
reject the counsel which comes from God, we do not
choose to be independent of outside influence. We
choose another influence. We reject the protection of
a perfectly loving, all-powerful, all-knowing Father in
Heaven, whose whole purpose, as that of His Beloved
Son, is to give us eternal life, to give us all that He has,
and to bring us home again in families to the arms

of His love. In rejecting His counsel, we choose the
influence of another power, whose purpose is to make
us miserable and whose motive is hatred. We have

179
moral agency as a gift of God. Rather than the right

to choose to be free of influence, it is the inalienable
right to submit ourselves to whichever of those powers
we choose” (“Finding Safety in Counsel,” Ensign, May
1997, 25).

2. Write in your scripture study journal what you would
recommend a person do to protect herself or himself from
believing false doctrines like those taught by Korihor.

Alma 30:30-60

Korihor demands a sign from Alma and is struck dumb by
the power of God

Eventually, Korihor was brought before Alma. Read
Alma 30:30-31, and look for the accusations Korihor
made against Alma and other Church leaders.
“Glutting on the labors of the people” implies that
Alma and others grew rich because of their Church
service. Think about the answers to the following
questions:

¢ From your experience with your Church leaders,
why are these accusations false?

¢ How do you think you would have responded to
Korihor’s accusations if you were Alma?

Read Alma 30:32-35, and discover Alma’s response
to Korihor. Think about how you have seen the
truthfulness of Alma’s response in the lives of those
who lead your ward or branch or of other Church
members you admire.

If possible, invite a friend or family member to read
Alma 30:37-45 with you. One of you read the words of
Alma, and the other the words of Korihor. As the two
of you read, look for what Alma stated as evidence of
God’s existence. (If it is not possible to have someone
read with you, imagine the exchange going on
between the two men as you read.)

3. Complete the following assignments in your scripture
study journal:
a. Write down which one of the evidences Alma cited is an
especially meaningful witness to you of the existence of God
and why it is such a strong witness of His existence.
b. Write down at least three other evidences you have seen in
your life that “denote that there is a God” (Alma 30:44), and
explain briefly how each one has strengthened your belief in
God.

One doctrine found in the verses you studied is: All
things testify of God as Supreme Creator. Consider
what happens to your faith when you choose to look
for and remember these witnesses and testimonies.

180

Notice what the prophet Alma did as he interacted
with Korihor: he corrected the false teachings (see
Alma 30:32-35), he testified of truth (see Alma
30:37-39), he shifted the burden of proof to Korihor
(see Alma 30:40—42), and he gave evidences of God’s
existence (see Alma 30:44). What can you learn from
Alma’s example about how to deal with those who
argue against the truth?

Sometimes the only defense we have
against those who attack our faith is to
share our testimony of the truth. There is
no embarrassment in taking this
approach—Alma, a prophet of God, used
this approach with Korihor. As Elder
Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles explained: “Korihor’s arguments sound very
contemporary to the modern reader, but Alma used a
timeless and ultimately undeniable weapon in
response—the power of personal testimony” (Christ
and the New Covenant [1997], 121).

Despite the many evidences, or signs, that Alma
shared with Korihor to prove God’s existence, Korihor
asked for another sign and was struck dumb (meaning
he could not speak; see Alma 30:45—-50). Read Alma
30:51-53, looking for why Korihor said he taught what
he did.

When Korihor could no longer teach false doctrines,
he admitted that he had taught his false ideas “because
they were pleasing unto the carnal mind” (Alma
30:53). Having a “carnal mind” refers to being focused
on worldly pleasures or satisfying the lusts of the body.
Those who believed Korihor’s teachings thought they
could indulge in physical pleasures and material things
and there would be no consequences. These ideas led
to a life of sin (see Alma 30:18).

Alma 30:54-59 tells that Korihor was cast out, went
from house to house begging for food, and eventually
was trampled to death. Read Alma 30:60, and look for
an important truth about what eventually happens to
those who choose to follow Satan. Mark the following
phrase in your scriptures: “The devil will not support
his children [his followers] at the last day.” (In this
verse, children means followers.)

4. Answer the following questions in your scripture study
journal:
a. How was the truth you marked in Alma 30:60 manifested in
Korihor’s life?
b. Compare Alma 30:60 with Alma 36:3. What evidence have
you seen in your life or in the lives of others that shows God
will continue to support those who strive to follow His
commandments?

Review the true principles and doctrines you have
studied today. Think of ways you can avoid being
deceived by false teachings, such as those of Korihor.

Alma 31

Introduction

Alma learned that a group of Nephite dissenters called
the Zoramites had strayed from the truth of the gospel.
Saddened by these reports of wickedness, Alma took
others with him to teach the Zoramites the word of
God. They witnessed the apostate worship services
and the pride of the Zoramites. Alma prayed earnestly
that he and his companions would find comfort and
success in bringing the Zoramites back to the Lord.

Alma 31:1-7

Alma and his companions preach the word of God to the
apostate Zoramites

Imagine that you have a friend or family member
who is beginning to stray from the gospel or who is
not living the gospel as fully as he or she could. Think
about answers to the following questions:

¢ What might you do to help this person return to the
Church and desire to keep the commandments?

¢ Who might you turn to for help in dealing with this
person’s problems and misunderstandings?

This lesson highlights how Alma and others tried

to help a group of people who had strayed from the
truths of the gospel. Read Alma 31:1-2. How did Alma
feel when he heard about what the Zoramites were
doing?

Read Alma 31:34, and discover why the Nephites
began to fear because of the Zoramites’ actions.

Thinking of what you have learned during your study
of the Book of Mormon, what do you think would
help encourage the Zoramites to repent and return to
the truths of the gospel? Read Alma 31:5, and identify
what Alma knew would be the most effective way to
reclaim the Zoramites.

1. In your scripture study journal, write down why you
think the word of God is more powerful in helping people
to change than using force or anything else.

Ponder the following statement from President Boyd K.
Packer, President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles,
about the power of the word of God:

“True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and
behavior.

“The study of the doctrines of the gospel
will improve behavior quicker than a
study of behavior will improve behavior.
Preoccupation with unworthy behavior
can lead to unworthy behavior. That is
why we stress so forcefully the study of
the doctrines of the gospel” (“Little Children,” Ensign,
Nov. 1986, 17).

Based on Alma 31:5 and President Packer’s statement,
finish the following principle: As I study the word of
God, it will lead me to

Among other possibilities, you could finish the above
principle this way: As I study the word of God, it will
lead me to do that which is right.

2. Ponder your experiences with the scriptures and
hearing the word of God. Write about a time when the
word of God led you, your family, or friends to do what was right.

181
Alma 31:8-23
The Zoramites pray and worship in a false manner

Alma and seven others went to preach the word
of God to the Zoramites. When they arrived, they
observed the Zoramites worshiping God in an
astonishing way. What comes to mind when you
think of the word worship?

Worship refers to how we show love, reverence, and
devotion for God. Worship often includes actions such
as praying, fasting, and attending church services.
However, true worship always involves the heart.
Read Alma 31:8-11, and identify and mark words and
phrases that describe the worship of the Zoramites.

It may be helpful to know that “performances of the
church” (Alma 31:10) are related to “ordinances,” such
as the sacrifices required at that time as part of the law
of Moses or the sacrament in our day. You may want
to mark in Alma 31:10 one of the reasons we should
worship and pray daily.

Consider writing this principle in the margin of your
scriptures next to Alma 31:9-11: Our daily efforts
to pray and keep the commandments fortify us
against temptation.

Elder Rulon G. Craven, while serving as a member
of the Seventy, emphasized the importance of daily
personal worship as a protection against temptation
and error: “During the past years I have at times
been asked by the Brethren to meet with repentant
members of the Church and interview them for the
restoration of their temple blessings. This has always
been a spiritually moving experience to restore

182

the blessings of those wonderful people who have
repented. I have asked some of them the question,
‘What happened in your life that caused you to
temporarily lose your membership in the Church?’
With tear-filled eyes they answered: ‘I didn’t obey the
basic principles of the gospel: prayer, attending church
regularly, serving in church and studying the gospel. I
then gave in to temptations and lost the guidance of
the Holy Spirit’” (“Temptation,” Ensign, May 1996, 76).

How does Elder Craven’s statement support the truth
found in Alma 31:9-11?

Read Alma 31:12-23, and imagine what it would be like
to hear the Zoramites pray from their tower. Think about
answers to the following questions:

e What concerns would you have if you heard someone
praying in this manner?

e What are some false doctrines the Zoramites recited
in their prayer?

e What was their attitude toward other people?
(Notice how many times the words we and us appear
in the Zoramites’ prayer.)

After each person had repeated the same prayer, “they
returned to their homes, never speaking of their God
again until they had assembled themselves together
again to the holy stand” (Alma 31:23).

3. Answer the following questions in your scripture study
journal:

a. What are some dangers of worshipping, praying, and
speaking of God only once a week?

b. What are some ways we can worship God throughout the
week?

Our attitude is also important as we worship. Read the
following statement from Elder Dallin H. Oaks of the
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles about how our attitude
affects our worship:

“Worship often includes actions, but true worship
always involves a particular attitude of mind.

“The attitude of worship evokes the
deepest feelings of allegiance, adoration,
and awe. Worship combines love and
reverence in a state of devotion that draws
our spirits closer to God” (Pure in Heart
[1988], 125).

4. Write in your scripture study journal about how well

you believe you are doing in your worship, including your
attitude, in the following categories: (a) daily personal prayer,
(b) daily personal scripture study, (c) obedience to the
commandments, and (d) attending church meetings and
partaking of the sacrament weekly. Set a goal to improve your
personal, daily worship. You may also want to tell a parent,
leader, or friend about your goal so he or she can offer you
encouragement throughout the coming weeks.

Alma 31:24-38

Alma prays for strength and success for the missionaries
in bringing the Zoramites back to the Lord

After witnessing the Zoramites’ apostate worship,
Alma prayed to the Lord. Read Alma 31:30-35,
and look for how Alma’s prayer differed from the
Zoramites’ prayer.

5. In your scripture study journal, write what you learned

about how to pray from comparing Alma’s prayer with
the Zoramites’ prayer. Also record how Alma’s example of a
righteous prayer can influence your personal prayers.

Read Alma 31:36—38, and look for the blessings that
came to Alma and his companions as they received
priesthood blessings and preached the gospel. Note
that the phrase “he clapped his hands upon all them
who were with him” (Alma 30:36) refers to the laying
on of hands.

Alma and his companions’ experience teaches the
principle: If we pray and act in faith, then we will
receive divine help in our trials.

Following his prayer, Alma and his companions
demonstrated their faith by going to work and trusting
in the Lord to provide for them as they served Him
and His children. Look for ways you can follow Alma’s
example of praying in faith.

6. Write the following at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture study journal:
| have studied Alma 31 and completed this lesson on (date).

Additional questions, thoughts, and insights | would like to share
with my teacher:

Alma 32

Introduction

After witnessing the Zoramites’ apostate form of
worship, Alma and his companions preached the
word of God to them. They began to experience some
success among the people who were poor and cast
out of the Zoramite synagogues. Using an analogy

of the planting and nourishing of a seed, Alma taught
them what they must do to receive and nourish faith
in the word of God. Alma invited them (and us) to
experiment on the word and to nourish their faith
and testimony daily.

Alma 32:1-16

Alma teaches Zoramites who have been humbled because
of their poverty

1. Imagine that a friend asked you how a person can

know if the Church is true. In your scripture study journal,
write your response about how to gain a testimony. Then write
How to receive and strengthen a testimony on the next line of
your journal. As you study Alma 32, make a list under this
heading of insights you discover about how to receive and
strengthen a testimony. You will continue adding to this list
throughout the lesson; therefore, it will be helpful to leave some
extra space between this first scripture study journal assignment
and assignment 2.

In the previous lesson (Alma 31), you read about how
Alma and his brethren observed the false worship of
the Zoramites, a group of Nephites who had fallen
away from the truth. Following Alma’s prayer of

faith, he and his brethren began to preach the gospel
among these people. Read Alma 32:1-3, and look

for which group of Zoramites showed interest in the
missionaries’ message.

Read Alma 32:4—6, and identify how the effects of their
poverty were a blessing.

One principle illustrated in these verses is: Humility
prepares us to receive the word of God. Write

be humble in your scripture study journal under the
heading “How to receive and strengthen a testimony.”

2. In your scripture study journal, write why you think
humility is essential to receiving and strengthening a
testimony.

Read Alma 32:13-16, looking for different ways people
may become humble. Based on what Alma taught,

183
would you rather choose to be humble or be compelled
to be humble? Why?

Consider what you think it means to humble yourself
“because of the word” (Alma 32:14). How might

it apply to your attitude toward Church activity,
seminary, or family home evening?

Choose to be humble by putting into practice any
promptings you have received regarding your own
humility.

Alma 32:17-43

Alma teaches the Zoramites how to increase their faith

While teaching the Zoramites, Alma identified

one false idea many people had about obtaining a
testimony. Read Alma 32:17-18, and identify this false
idea.

Consider for a moment how expecting a sign could
be an obstacle for building faith and testimony. (You
may want to write D&C 63:9-11 in the margin of your
scriptures next to Alma 32:17-18 and read it for more
insight.)

Read Alma 32:21, a scripture mastery passage, and look
for Alma’s definition of what faith is and what it is not.
(You may want to mark it in a distinctive way so you
can locate it in the future.)

Read Alma 32:22. Ponder what you can do to develop
greater faith and personal testimony.

Add remember the mercy of God and choose to believe to
your scripture study journal list of “How to receive and
strengthen a testimony.”

Alma taught the Zoramites how they could begin to
believe in the word of God by trying an experiment.
Think of some experiments you have conducted in
science classes or other classes and the steps you
followed. Note that experiments require action on
the part of the researcher. Likewise, the process of
receiving or strengthening a testimony requires action
on your part. Read Alma 32:27, and look for the
experiment Alma invited the Zoramites to try.

It may be helpful to know that the word faculties
means the powers or abilities we are blessed with to
perceive and understand the world around us. They
include such things as our senses of hearing, sight,
and touch; rational thought; and memory.

Add experiment (or act) upon the word to your scripture
study journal list of “How to receive and strengthen a
testimony.”

184

As you read Alma 32:28, you might want to mark
in your scriptures phrases such as “begin to swell,”
“enlarge my soul,” “enlighten my understanding,”
and “delicious to me.” Elder Bruce R. McConkie of
the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught how our
faith grows:

“We grow in faith; we go step by step
from a lower degree to a higher degree.
We add grace to grace until eventually we
get to a state where we have perfected our
faith, as far as at least the generality of
righteous, mortal men can, and we are
then at the place to go on in eternity in eternal
progress... .

“Work on the projects ahead and when you have
taken one step in the acquiring of faith, it will give
you the assurance in your soul that you can go
forward and take the next step, and by degrees your
power or influence will increase” (Lord, Increase Our
Faith, Brigham Young University Speeches of the Year
[Oct. 31, 1967], 9, 11).

3. After reading Alma 32:28, complete two or more of
the following assignments in your scripture study journal:
a. What actions must we either take or not take as we conduct
this experiment on the word? (A list of some possible answers is
included at the end of the lesson.)
b. What do you think it means to “give place, that [the word of
God] may be planted in your heart” ?
c. When have you felt the word of God enlarge your soul and

enlighten your understanding? Describe in your own words what
that felt like.

4

Alma 32:28 Alma 32:30 Alma 32:30-34

Read Alma 32:29-34, and mark the words or phrases
that describe what an individual will learn about the
word of God as he or she performs the experiment.
The word nourish means to feed, maintain, or care for.

Think for a moment how the process of helping

a tree to grow is similar to that of helping your
testimony to grow. Also consider why someone’s faith
and testimony is not perfect after performing the
experiment with the word of God. What more do you
think needs to be done to have a lasting testimony of
the gospel?
Read Alma 32:35—40, carefully looking for what Alma
said we must do to complete the experiment. Ponder
what you must do for the tree, or your testimony, to

grow. What will happen if you fail to do these things?

Alma 32:37

Close your scriptures, and see how many of the
following questions you can answer:

¢ What must we do to have our faith in the word of
God grow into a fruit-bearing tree?

e What do you think the fruit represents?

e What happens when we neglect the tree or fail to
nourish it?

e How do you think that is like what happens when
we neglect or fail to nourish a testimony?

If necessary, open your scriptures and review Alma
32:35—40 to help you answer the questions. Add
diligently nourish to your “How to receive and
strengthen a testimony” scripture study journal list.

Summarize in one sentence what you learned
from Alma 32 about what is required to receive or
strengthen a testimony, and write this principle in
your scriptures near Alma 32:37-43.

You may have written something like: If we diligently
nourish our faith in God’s word in our hearts, our
faith and our testimony of Jesus Christ and His
gospel will grow.

Read Alma 32:41—43, looking for how Alma described
the fruit that comes to those who faithfully nourish
their testimonies. Alma 32:42 mentions diligence and

Alma 32:41-42

patience. Why do you think it takes diligence and
patience for the tree—or your testimony—to grow?

4. Answer one or both questions in your scripture study
journal:

a. What results have you seen in your life as you have followed
the experiment Alma described in Alma 32?

b. How will you apply the experiment Alma described in
Alma 32 in your life?

C2) Scripture Mastery—Alma 32:21

5. Read Alma 32:21 again. Try to memorize this verse,

and then recite it from memory to a friend or family
member. Write a few sentences in your scripture study journal
explaining what this verse teaches you about faith.

Possible answers for assignment 3a: (a) give place
for the word (or seed) to be planted in your heart,
(b) do not cast out the seed by your unbelief, and
(c) recognize the growth of the seed.

6. Write the following at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture study journal:
| have studied Alma 32 and completed this lesson on (date).

Additional questions, thoughts, and insights | would like to share
with my teacher:

Alma 33-35

Introduction

Using teachings found in the scriptures, Alma helped
many of the Zoramites understand that they could
worship God regardless of their circumstances.

He encouraged them to look to Jesus Christ and
believe in His Atonement. Amulek confirmed Alma’s
teachings and declared his own testimony of Jesus
Christ. Amulek emphasized that only through the
Atonement of Jesus Christ can mankind be saved. He
promised that individuals can receive all the blessings
of the Atonement of Jesus Christ as they exercise faith
unto repentance. Many Zoramites heeded Amulek’s
warning, repented, and rejoined the Nephites.

185
Alma 33:1-10

Alma teaches a group of Zoramites that they can worship
God outside their synagogues

Recall that, as recorded in Alma 32, Alma taught the
Zoramites about the need to plant the word of God
in their hearts and to exercise faith in the word of
God. Read Alma 33:1, and identify the questions the
Zoramites had about what Alma had taught them.

1. In your scripture study journal, write how you would

answer the Zoramites’ question about how they should
begin to exercise their faith. Then, as you study Alma 33-34,
compare your response to what Alma and Amulek taught the
Zoramites.

As Alma began to answer the Zoramites’ questions, he
corrected a false idea about worship that was preventing
them from fully exercising their faith. Read Alma 33:2,
and identify this false idea. Recall that the Zoramites did
not allow the poorer people to enter their synagogues
to worship (see Alma 32:1-3). According to Alma 33:2,
what did Alma tell the people they should do to find an
answer to correct this false idea?

To correct the Zoramites’ false ideas about worshiping
God, Alma quoted scriptures written by a prophet
named Zenos. Zenos had taught the people of Israel in
Old Testament times, but his prophecies are recorded
only in the Book of Mormon. Read Alma 33:3, and find
the word Alma used to describe worship.

Consider writing the following principle in your
scriptures near Alma 33:3 or in your scripture study
journal: We can worship God continually through

prayer.

Read Alma 33:4-11, and mark each of the
circumstances in which Zenos prayed. What did the
Lord do each time Zenos prayed? To help you liken
these verses to your life, draw a line matching the
circumstances in which Zenos prayed to possible
similar circumstances in your own life. (Choose the
situations that relate best to your life. There are no
right or wrong answers in this exercise.)

186

Zenos's Circumstances

Your Circumstances

In the wilderness

At work

Concerning his enemies

At church

In his fiel Family prayer

In his house When you do not know what to
do or are afraid

In his closet When you feel alone

In the Lord's Personal prayer

When he was cast out
and despised

In all your difficult circumstance

In all his affliction

When you are having trouble
with friends

2. Answer the following question in your scripture study
journal: How could praying in all of these circumstances

bless your life? Write a personal goal of how you could pray more

often.

Consider marking phrases in Alma 33:4—5, 8-9 that
mention God’s mercy, and ponder how praying more
often can help you feel God’s mercy and love. Be
looking for why this mercy is possible as you continue

to study Alma 33.

Alma 33:11-23

Alma teaches the Zoramites to believe in Jesus Christ

One reason some of the Zoramites were struggling to
know how to worship God was because they did not
know that their faith should be in Jesus Christ. They
did not understand or believe in His role in the plan
of salvation (see Alma 33:14). Read Alma 33:12-16,

in which Alma discussed the teachings of Zenos

and then introduced the words of Zenock, another
Old Testament prophet. Look for the blessings Alma
identified that come to us because of Jesus Christ. You
may want to mark the phrase “because of thy Son”
each time it appears. From these verses we learn this
truth: We receive Heavenly Father's mercy, including

forgiveness for our sins, because of the Atonement
of Jesus Christ. Ponder the mercies Heavenly Father
has bestowed upon you, including the ability to repent
and be forgiven of your sins, because of the Atonement
of the Savior.

Besides reminding the Zoramites of the teachings of
Zenos and Zenock, Alma also reminded them of a time
when Moses taught about the Savior’s Atonement.
When Moses and the children of Israel were in the
wilderness, poisonous
serpents bit the people.
The Lord told Moses to
make a serpent out of
brass, fasten it upon a
pole, and command the
Israelites who had been
bitten to look at it.The
brass serpent on the
pole was a “type” ora
symbol of Jesus Christ
on the cross (see Alma
33:19).

Read Alma 33:19-20, and identify what happened to
the Israelites who chose to look at the brass serpent
when they were bitten and what happened to those
who chose not to look.

Ponder answers to the following questions: What does
the account of the Israelites and the brass serpent teach
us about what we must do to be healed spiritually?
What can you do to look to the Savior so that He can
help you spiritually?

3. Answer the following question in your scripture study
journal: What are some specific ways you can look to
Jesus Christ in your everyday life?

Read Alma 33:22—23, and mark what we need to believe
about Jesus Christ in order to exercise faith in Him.

Alma 34:1-14

Amulek teaches the Zoramites about the Atonement of
Jesus Christ

Amulek’s testimony to the Zoramites, as recorded

in Alma 34, provided a second witness to Alma’s
testimony of Jesus Christ. Read a portion of Amulek’s
testimony, found in Alma 34:8—9, and consider
marking what Amulek taught about the need for the
Atonement of Jesus Christ. Ponder this question: What
would my life be like if Jesus Christ had not come and
fulfilled His special role?

Read Alma 34:10-14, and identify phrases that
include the words infinite and eternal. Write the
following truth in your scriptures or scripture study
journal: The infinite and eternal Atonement of
Jesus Christ provides salvation for all mankind.

To help us understand how the Atonement is infinite
and eternal, Bishop Richard C. Edgley of the Presiding
Bishopric taught: “In speaking of Christ’s Atonement,
I like the dictionary’s definition of infinite and eternal
because I believe they explain exactly what God
meant. Infinite: ‘Having no boundaries or limits.’ And
the definition of eternal: ‘Being without beginning

or end’ (The American Heritage Dictionary of the

English Language, 4th ed. [2000], “infinite,” “eternal,”
898, 611)” (“For Thy Good,” Ensign, May 2002, 66).

4. Answer the following questions in your scripture study
journal:

a. In what ways can the Atonement of Jesus Christ be infinite
and eternal?

b. How does knowing the Atonement is infinite and eternal
increase your appreciation for the Savior? How does it increase
you faith in Him?

187
Alma 34:15-41

Amulek teaches how to receive the blessings of the
Atonement

Read Alma 34:15-17 to see what Amulek taught the
Zoramites they needed to do to receive the blessings
the Savior desires to give us through His Atonement.
Write the following truth in your scriptures or scripture
study journal: In order to receive the full blessings
of the Atonement, we must exercise faith unto
repentance.

Read the following statement from President Dieter F.
Uchtdorf of the First Presidency:

“We need a strong faith in Christ to be
able to repent... . If we believe that God
knows all things, is loving, and is merciful,
we will be able to put our trust in Him for
our salvation without wavering. Faith in
Christ will change our thoughts, beliefs,
and behaviors that are not in harmony with God’s will.

“True repentance brings us back to doing what is right.
... Repentance means a change of mind and heart—
we stop doing things that are wrong, and we start
doing things that are right. It brings us a fresh attitude
toward God, oneself, and life in general” (“Point of
Safe Return,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2007, 100).

5. Answer the following question in your scripture study
journal: How do we exercise faith in Jesus Christ as we
repent?

Read Alma 34:17-27, and look for what Amulek taught
about when we should pray and what we should

pray about. How do you think this counsel helped

the Zoramites, who thought they could worship only
once a week? Choose one verse that you think can
particularly help you. Think about how you can follow
the counsel about prayer in this verse during the
coming week.

Amulek taught that we should be willing to accept the
blessings of the Savior’s Atonement by repenting of our
sins now, rather than waiting to repent later. Read Alma
34:30-35, and underline words or phrases that identify
why we should not procrastinate our repentance. In
verse 31, look for the blessing that Amulek said will
come to those who choose to repent now. Carefully
review verse 32, and then consider: How can this verse
affect the way I live each day?

Review Alma 34:33, and consider what President
Joseph Fielding Smith said: “Procrastination, as it may
be applied to gospel principles, is the thief of eternal
life, which is life in the presence of the Father and the
Son. There are many among us, even members of the

188

Church, who feel that there is no need for haste in
the observance of gospel principles and the keeping
of the commandments” (in Conference Report, April
1969, 121).

Alma 35
Repentant Zoramites dwell among the righteous

Many Zoramites heeded Amulek’s warning not to
procrastinate their repentance, and they repented and
changed their lives. The rulers of the Zoramites cast
them out of their land, and these people came to the
land of Jershon, where they were welcomed by the
people of Ammon—also called the Anti-Nephi-Lehies
(see Alma 35:6-7). The wicked Zoramites and the
Lamanites became angry that the people of Ammon
had accepted the repentant Zoramites, and they began
making preparations for war against the Nephites (see
Alma 35:8-11).

6. Write the following at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture study journal:

| have studied Alma 33-35 and completed this lesson on (date).

Additional questions, thoughts, and insights | would like to share
with my teacher:

Alma 36

Introduction

After Alma returned from his mission to the Zoramites,
he gathered together his three sons and gave individual
counsel to each one (see Alma 35:16). His counsel to
Helaman is recorded in Alma 36-37, his counsel to
Shiblon is recorded in Alma 38, and his counsel to
Corianton is recorded in Alma 39-42. Alma testified to
Helaman that God will deliver those who put their trust
in Him. To illustrate this truth, Alma described how he
had been delivered from the pain of his sins many years
earlier. After calling on the name of Jesus Christ, he

had been born of God and filled with joy. He had then
labored to bring others to Jesus Christ.
Alma 36:1-5

Alma teaches his son Helaman about God's power to
support us in our trials

Ponder how the testimony or a particular teaching of
a family member, friend, or Church leader has blessed
yout life.

Read Alma 36:15, and imagine yourself in Helaman’s
position as he listened to his father’s testimony. What
did Alma want Helaman to remember? (See verse 2.)
What did Alma want Helaman to learn from him?
(See verse 3.)

Write the following principle in your scriptures next
to Alma 36:3: When we put our trust in God, He
supports us in all our trials and afflictions. Think
of a time when you had a trial in your life. In the space
provided, write a few ways in which God helped and
supported you during that time.

Alma 36:6-22

Alma describes his rebellion and explains how he
received forgiveness

Alma described to his son Helaman how God had
delivered him from the pain of his sins. Read Alma
36:6-10, and review what happened to Alma in his
youth as he went about with the sons of Mosiah
seeking to destroy the Church.

In the Book of Mormon there are three accounts

of the angel visiting Alma and the sons of Mosiah.
Alma 36 contains the most detailed account of what
Alma experienced during the three days and nights
when he was unable to move or talk. (To read the
other accounts, see Mosiah 27 and Alma 38.) Read
Alma 36:11-16, and mark words or phrases that Alma
used to describe the fear or pain he experienced after
the angel appeared.

189
President Boyd K. Packer of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles helped us understand what racked and
harrowed up mean:

“Racked means ‘tortured.’ Anciently a rack
was a framework on which the victim was
laid with each ankle and wrist tied to a
spindle which could then be turned to
cause unbearable pain.

“A harrow is a frame with spikes through
it. When pulled across the ground, it rips and tears into
the soil. The scriptures frequently speak of souls and
minds being ‘harrowed up’ with guilt” (“The Touch of
the Master’s Hand,” Ensign, May 2001, 23).

1. In your scripture study journal, write why you think

Alma used such strong words to describe how he felt.
Also write how these words describe the guilt and pain of a
person who has sinned and not repented.

You may want to write the following truth in your
scriptures near Alma 36:11—-16: Sin can lead to pain
and regret.

Read Alma 36:17-18, and look for what Alma
remembered his father prophesying about. Notice
what Alma did when he remembered what his father
had taught him.

Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles gave the following insight into Alma’s
experience: “Alma had been touched by the teaching
of his father, but it is particularly important that the
prophecy he remembered was one regarding ‘the
coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for
the sins of the world.’ (Alma 36:17.) That is the name
and that is the message that every person must hear.
Alma heard it, and he cried out from the anguish of a
hell that kept burning and a conscience that wouldn’t
heal. ‘O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me.’
(Alma 36:18.) . .. Whatever other prayers we offer,
whatever other needs we have, all somehow depends
on that plea: ‘O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy
on me.’ He is prepared to provide that mercy. He paid
with his very life in order to give it” (However Long and
Hard the Road [1985], 85).

2. Think back on a time when you have prayed to receive

the blessings of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, including
the blessing of forgiveness for a sin. In your scripture study
journal, write why you think it is important to ask the Lord for
the blessings of the Atonement in your life.

3. Read Alma 36:19-22, and mark words and phrases
that describe how Alma changed after he prayed for
mercy. Write some of these words and phrases in your scripture

190

study journal, and explain what they teach you about the power
of the Savior’s Atonement.

From these scriptures we learn this principle: If we
exercise faith in the Atonement of Jesus Christ,
then He will deliver us from the pain of our sins
and fill us with joy. Ponder what you can do to
exercise more faith in Jesus Christ so that, like Alma,
you can be delivered from feelings of pain or remorse
for your sins.

Read the following situation, and consider how you
might respond: A friend who has been reading the
Book of Mormon asks you for help in understanding
Alma’s words in Alma 36:19. Your friend asks, “If I can
remember my sins and still feel sorry for them, does it
mean | haven’t been forgiven?”

Read the following explanation from President Dieter F.
Uchtdorf of the First Presidency, and underline any
phrases you believe would be helpful to your friend:

“Satan will try to make us believe that our sins are
not forgiven because we can remember them. Satan
is a liar; he tries to blur our vision and lead us away
from the path of repentance and forgiveness. God did
not promise that we would not remember our sins.
Remembering will help us avoid making the same
mistakes again. But if we stay true and faithful, the
memory of our sins will be softened over time. This
will be part of the needed healing and sanctification
process. Alma testified that after he cried out to Jesus
for mercy, he could still remember his sins, but the
memory of his sins no longer distressed and tortured
him, because he knew he had been forgiven (see Alma
36:17-19).

“Tt is our responsibility to avoid anything that would
bring back old sinful memories. When we continue
to have a ‘broken heart and a contrite spirit’ (8 Nephi
12:19), we may trust that God will ‘remember [our
sins] no more’ [D&C 58:42]” (“Point of Safe Return,”
Ensign or Liahona, May 2007, 101).

It is also important to note that Alma did not say
that he remembered his sins no more but that he
remembered the pain of his sins no more, and he
was no longer “harrowed up” by their memory
(Alma 36:19). True repentance will cause the pain
and guilt of sin to be swept away (see Enos 1:6-8).

4. \n your scripture study journal, write an answer to

the friend mentioned above, and use insights you gained
from President Uchtdorf's explanation. Include in your answer
why you think it is a blessing that we still remember our sins,
even though we may not be “harrowed up by the memory of
[our] sins” (Alma 36:19) after our repentance.

Alma 36:23-30

Alma explains why he labors continually to bring others
to repentance

How do you feel when you share delicious food
with a friend? When you receive an exciting piece of
news, what is the first thing you want to do? Why
do you think most people have an almost instant
desire to share what they have heard with someone
else? Read Alma 36:23-24, and look for how the
feelings described in these questions relate to Alma’s
experience following his conversion. What did Alma
want other people to experience?

Read Alma 36:25-26, and identify how Alma’s efforts
to teach the gospel affected him and others. Complete
the following principle, based on what you have
learned about sharing the gospel from these verses: As
we share the gospel with others, we receive

5. Write your completed principle statement in your

scripture study journal, and explain why you believe this
principle is true. As part of your explanation, you may want to
include experiences you have had with feeling joy from sharing
the gospel with others.

Think of someone you know—a friend, family member,
or ward or branch member—who might benefit from
your testimony of the Savior and His restored gospel.
Ponder how you might share with this person your
testimony of how Jesus Christ is able to deliver us from
pain and fill us with joy. You may want to consider
writing a letter or e-mail to this person, or you may
want to write a few notes to prepare for a specific time
when you will speak with the person.

Alma 37

Introduction

As recorded in Alma 37, Alma continued his counsel
to his son Helaman and gave him charge of the sacred
records. He reminded Helaman that the scriptures
had already been the means of bringing thousands

of Lamanites to the Lord, and he prophesied that the
Lord had other great purposes for the records in the
future. Alma instructed his son in what he should teach
the people, and he taught Helaman the importance of
looking to the words of Jesus Christ for guidance by
comparing the Savior’s words to the Liahona.

Alma 37

Alma entrusts Helaman with the records, counsels him
to keep the commandments, and reminds him how the
Liahona worked according to faith

Consider the following diagram:

Small and
simple things ~att>

Think of two or three small and simple things that
have revolutionized the world, such as the lightbulb.
Think of some small things that have made a big
difference for good in your life. Write two of these
small things on the left side of the diagram above.
On the right side, write a few words describing the
big effect these small things have had on yout life.

Lead to
great things

As recorded in Alma 37, Alma was preparing his son
Helaman to become the next keeper of the sacred
records. Alma taught Helaman a principle about the
role of small and simple things in the Lord’s plan.
Read Alma 37:6-7, and then complete the following
principle: To bring about His eternal purposes, the
Lord works by

Read Alma 37:1-7, and look for what Alma described
as a small and simple thing. Also search Alma 37:8-10,
looking for ways the plates of brass (which contained
the scriptures) led to great things for the people of the
Book of Mormon. As you read, mark in your scriptures
which of these blessings you have also received
through your own scripture study.

192

1. Answer the following question in your scripture study
journal: What are two or three ways the scriptures have
caused great things to happen in your life?

Alma 37:13-16 records the counsel Alma gave to
Helaman as he gave his son charge of the records.
Study these verses, and look for principles that Alma
taught. One of these principles is: If we obey the
Lord’s commandments, we will prosper. Ponder
how this principle relates to the diagram at the
beginning of this lesson.

As recorded in Alma 37:35-47, Alma instructed
Helaman to teach the people to overcome
wickedness and temptation through faith in the

Lord Jesus Christ. Below are two lesson outlines that
cover these teachings. Study each lesson and the
scriptures that go with it. Then prepare to teach one
of the lessons to a family member, your entire family
(perhaps as part of a family home evening lesson),

or a friend. You may want to make some adjustments
to the lesson depending on whom and where you
teach. Schedule a time, and teach the lesson on the
appointed day. Also, bring your lesson outline to your
next home-study class and be prepared, if called upon,
to teach your lesson to the class.

Lesson 1—Alma 37:35-37

Explain to those you teach that it is common for those
who plant trees to tie or strap a young tree to a stake
and remove the support later when the tree matures.
Ask: Why do you think a tree would need to have a
stake for support while it is young and growing?

Read the following experience from
the life of President Gordon B.
Hinckley:

President Gordon B. Hinckley
planted a young tree near his home
soon after he was married. He paid
little attention to it as the years
passed. One day he noticed the tree
was misshapen and leaning to the
west because winds from the east
had bent it while it was young and
supple. He went out and tried to
push it upright, but the trunk was
too thick. He tried using a rope and
pulleys to straighten it, but it would
not bend. Finally, he took his saw and
cut off the heavy branch on the west
side, which left an ugly scar. He later
said of the tree:

“More than half a century has passed
since I planted that tree. My daughter

and her family live there now. The other day I looked
again at the tree. It is large. Its shape is better. It is a
great asset to the home. But how serious was the
trauma of its youth and how brutal the treatment I
used to straighten it. I

“When it was first planted, a piece of
string would have held it in place
against the forces of the wind. I could
have and should have supplied that
string with ever so little effort. But I did
not, and it bent to the forces that came |
against it” (“Bring up a Child in the if

Way He Should Go,” Ensign, Nov.
1993, 59).

Have someone read Alma’s counsel to Helaman in
Alma 37:35, and discuss how this verse relates to
President Hinckley’s experience with the tree. (Alma
37:35 is a scripture mastery passage. You may want to

mark it in a distinctive way so you can locate it in the
future.)

Invite those you teach to state a principle that
summarizes Alma 37:35. (It could be something like the
following: We should learn in our youth to keep the
commandments of God.) You may want to ask one or
more of the following questions:

e What difference do you think it could make
in people’s lives if they learned to keep the
commandments of God while they were young?

e How has keeping the commandments while in your
youth made a difference for you?

¢ Can you think of someone who was blessed for the
rest of his or her life because of having learned to
obey the commandments while young? How was
this person blessed?

Ask someone to read Alma 37:36-37 aloud and look
for specific counsel that could help a person keep the
commandments. Ask questions like the following:

¢ How could following this counsel daily help you to
keep the commandments?

e In what ways do you try to put the Lord first in your
thoughts and actions? How might you improve?

e What promises are given to those who are prayerful?

Share your testimony about how counseling with the
Lord has helped you keep the commandments. Invite
those you are teaching to follow Alma’s words on
counseling with the Lord.

Lesson 2—Alma 37:38-45

Ask those you are teaching if they know the name of
the compass the Lord gave Lehi’s family that helped
them travel to the promised land. Then ask someone
to read Alma 37:38. Explain that Alma referred to the
Liahona to teach Helaman an important principle
about how the Lord guides His children.

Have those you are teaching answer the following
questions by reading the verses mentioned and
searching for the answer:

¢ According to Alma 37:38—40, how did the Liahona
work?

¢ According to Alma 37:41—42, why did the Liahona
cease to work at times?

¢ According to Alma 37:43—45, how is the Liahona like
the words of Christ?

Explain that the words shadow and type (Alma

37:43, 45) mean that something is used as a symbol of
a larger idea. For example, Lehi’s family’s obedience or
disobedience to the directions of the Liahona is a

symbol of our choices to obey or disobey the words of
Christ. Just as Lehi’s family reached the promised land
by following the Liahona, we will receive eternal life as
we follow the words of Christ.

193
Ask someone to explain where we can find the words
of Jesus Christ in our lives. (Some possible answers

might be the scriptures, words of modern prophets, a
patriarchal blessing, and the promptings of the Spirit.)

Ask: What principles was Alma teaching Helaman by
using the example of the Liahona? (Answers might be
something like the following principle: If we heed the
words of Jesus Christ, they will direct us to receive
eternal life.) You may want to share your testimony
that listening to and obeying the words of the Lord
will bring great blessings into our lives.

Alma 38

Introduction

Alma’s son Shiblon served with him as a missionary to
the Zoramites. Following this mission, Alma expressed
joy in the steadiness and faithfulness Shiblon had

194

demonstrated while suffering persecution among the
Zoramites. Alma testified to Shiblon of Jesus Christ’s
power of deliverance and counseled him to continue
to teach the gospel.

Alma 38:1-3

Alma expresses joy in Shiblon’s faithfulness

Take a minute to think of a time when your parents
felt joy because of a good decision you or another
family member made or because of the way you are
living yout life.

Read Alma 38:1-3, and look for phrases that describe
how Alma felt about Shiblon and why. Write some of
the phrases you found:

From these verses we learn this principle: As we
begin in our youth to be steady and faithful in
keeping the commandments, we can bring great
joy to our parents.

1. Take a moment to ask one of your parents, guardians,
or Church leaders how your good decisions affect him or
her. Write their answers in your scripture study journal.

Alma 38:4-9

Alma testifies of the Savior's power to deliver

Alma reminded Shiblon that they had both experienced
the Savior’s power of deliverance, although in different
ways. Read Alma 38:48, and complete the chart below.
Also use what you know about Shiblon from Alma
38:2-3 and what you have learned about Alma from
other chapters in the Book of Mormon to help you
complete the chart.
Shiblon (Alma
38:2-5)

Alma (Alma
38:6-8)

What was he
delivered from?

How did he
receive the
blessing of
deliverance?

From Shiblon’s experience, we can learn: If we bear
all things with patience and trust in God, He will
deliver us from trials, troubles, and afflictions and
lift us up at the last day. From Alma’s experience we
also learn: To receive a remission of our sins and
find peace to our souls, we must exercise faith in
Jesus Christ and seek His mercy.

2. Answer the following questions in your scripture study
journal:
a. What do you learn from the account of Shiblon and Alma
about the Savior's power to deliver you?
b. Choose one of the principles shown in bold type in the

preceding paragraph, and write a few sentences about how you
can apply that principle to your life.

Read Alma 38:9, and look for what Alma wanted
Shiblon to learn. You may want to mark a phrase in this
verse that you feel summarizes what Alma wanted his
son to understand.

Think about a time when the Savior’s power delivered
you from trials, troubles, or unworthiness. What did
you do to seek that deliverance? Do you have trials or
sins in your life now? How can you turn to the Savior
for deliverance?

3. Answer the following question in your scripture study

journal: Why do you think it is important for you to know
that the only “way or means” by which you can be saved is
through the Savior? (see Alma 38:9).

Alma 38:10-15

Alma counsels Shiblon to continue developing righteous
attributes

Think of a teacher or Church leader who has had a
positive influence on your life. Consider the qualities
in that person that you admire.

As recorded in Alma 38:10-15, Alma encouraged
Shiblon to continue to develop qualities that would
help him as he continued to teach the gospel and
serve others. The counsel Alma gave Shiblon can
apply to anyone who wants to influence others for
good through service, teaching, and in other ways.
Study Alma 38:10-15, and identify any counsel you
feel could be especially helpful for you. You may want
to mark what you find.

4. Below is a study guide to help you further understand

and apply Alma’s counsel to his son Shiblon (see Alma
38:10-15). From the left column choose two or three parts of
Alma’s counsel that you feel would be of most worth to you.

Alma’‘s Counsel

Learning Activities

“Be diligent and
temperate in all
things” (Alma 38:10).

A person who is diligent puts
consistent and energetic effort into
life's activities. A person who is
temperate uses moderation in all
things and exercises self-control. In
your scripture study journal, write
why these two traits are needed
when serving others. Write how you
could be more diligent or temperate
in one or more areas of your life and
how doing so could help you serve
others more effectively.

“Bridle all your
passions” (Alma
38:12).

To bridle means to guide or control.
A passfonis a strong emotion.
Ponder the following questions and
record your answers in your scripture
study journal: Why do you think

it is important for us to bridle our
passions—in other words, to guide
or control our strong emotions? How
do you think bridling your passions
can help you be filled with love?
What will you do to follow Alma’s
counsel to bridle all your passions?

*See that ye are not
lifted up unto pride;
yea, see that ye do
not boast” (Alma
38:11).

Pride, in the scriptures, is when a
person puts greater trust in himself
or herself than in God. It also means
that a person thinks he or she is
superior to others. The opposite of
this unrighteous pride is humility.
Those who are humble strive to think
of others in the same way they think
of themselves, and they love God
and put Him first in their live . Write
in your scripture study journal what
might happen if a Church member
was prideful and boastful in his or
her calling. Think of your Church
calling or another opportunity you
have to serve. Write one or two ways
you will seek to be humble and avoid
pride or boasting as you serve.

"Use boldness, but
not overbearance”
(Alma 38:12).

To be bo/d means to be confident
that God is with us and can help us
act without fear in His service. To
be overbearing can mean to push
our beliefs or attitudes on others
without being sensitive to their
needs and feelings. In your scripture
study journal, write why you think
the Lord would want us to be bold.
Also record a specific ay in which
you can apply the counsel to use
boldness but not overbearance as
you seek to serve others.

196

“Refrain from
idleness” (Alma
38:12).

Look up “Idle, Idleness” in the Guide
to the Scriptures (scriptures.lds.org)
or “Idleness, Idle, Idler” in the Topical
Guide to learn more about what it
means to be idle. Choose two of the
verses listed under that topic, and
study them. Record what you learn
from these verses in your scripture
study journal. Write how the counsel
to refrain from idleness will help you
serve others more effectively. Finally,
write a specific ay in which you will
seek to refrain from idleness.

Alma’s counsel to Shiblon in Alma 38:10-15 teaches
this principle: Developing righteous attributes
prepares us to teach and serve others. Ponder how
developing the righteous attributes you read about
in Alma 38 can bless your life and the lives of those

around you.

Alma 39

Introduction

Alma reproved his wayward son, Corianton, who had
forsaken the ministry and committed serious sexual sin.
Alma taught Corianton the seriousness of his actions
and expressed his disappointment that Corianton was
guilty of such serious wrongdoing. Alma commanded
Corianton to stop going after “the lusts of his eyes” and
to repent (Alma 39:9). Alma’s message to Corianton is
found in Alma 39-42.

Alma 39:1-6

Alma explains the seriousness of sexual sin to his son
Corianton

Consider the following statement: Some sins are more
serious than other sins.

1. Respond to the following questions in your scripture
study journal: Do you agree that some sins are more
serious than other sins? Why or why not?

As recorded in Alma 39, Alma gave counsel to his son
Corianton that can help you understand the serious
nature of certain sins. Corianton had accompanied
Alma and his brother Shiblon on a mission to preach
the gospel to the Zoramites. While there, Corianton
committed a serious sexual sin.

Read Alma 39:1—4, and look for what Corianton had
done wrong. To help you understand these verses, it
may be helpful to know that a harlot is an immoral
woman or prostitute. It is important to understand that
“the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree
of allowance” (D&C 1:31); sexual sins are especially
serious. Notice too that Corianton purposely left his
mission to go after the harlot Isabel, which contributed
to the seriousness of his sin.

Read Alma 39:5, and look for how Alma explained
the seriousness of sexual sin compared to other sins.
An abomination is something that is sinful, wicked,
or vile. From these verses we learn that sexual sin is
an abomination in the sight of the Lord. Ponder
why you think sexual sin is ranked next to murder in
seriousness.

Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles gave this explanation about why sexual sin is
abominable to the Lord: “By assigning such seriousness
to a physical appetite so universally bestowed, what

is God trying to tell us about its place in His plan for

all men and women? | submit to you He is doing
precisely that—commenting about the very plan of life
itself. Clearly among His greatest concerns regarding
mortality are how one gets into this world and how
one gets out of it. He has set very strict limits in these
matters” (“Personal Purity,” Ensign, Nov. 1998, 76).

Read the following paragraphs, and look for and mark
answers to the following question: What are some of
the blessings of remaining sexually pure?

“Physical intimacy between husband and wife is
beautiful and sacred. It is ordained of God for the
creation of children and for the expression of love
between husband and wife. God has commanded
that sexual intimacy be reserved for marriage.

“When you are sexually pure, you prepare yourself to
make and keep sacred covenants in the temple. You
prepare yourself to build a strong marriage and to
bring children into the world as part of an eternal and
loving family. You protect yourself from the spiritual
and emotional damage that come from sharing sexual
intimacy outside of marriage. You also protect yourself
from harmful diseases. Remaining sexually pure helps
you to be confident and truly happy and improves your
ability to make good decisions now and in the future”
(For the Strength of Youth [booklet, 2011], 35).

Now read the following paragraphs, looking for answers
to the following question: What are the Lord’s standards
for remaining sexually pure?

“The Lord’s standard regarding sexual purity is clear
and unchanging. Do not have any sexual relations
before marriage, and be completely faithful to your
spouse after marriage. Do not allow the media, your
peers, or others to persuade you that sexual intimacy
before marriage is acceptable. It is not. In God’s sight,
sexual sins are extremely serious. They defile the sacred
power God has given us to create life. The prophet
Alma taught that sexual sins are more serious than any
other sins except murder or denying the Holy Ghost
(see Alma 39:5).

“Never do anything that could lead to sexual
transgression. Treat others with respect, not as objects
used to satisfy lustful and selfish desires. Before
marriage, do not participate in passionate kissing, lie on
top of another person, or touch the private, sacred parts
of another person’s body, with or without clothing. Do
not do anything else that arouses sexual feelings. Do not
arouse those emotions in your own body. Pay attention
to the promptings of the Spirit so that you can be clean
and virtuous. The Spirit of the Lord will withdraw from
one who is in sexual transgression.

197
“Avoid situations that invite increased temptation, such
as late-night or overnight activities away from home

or activities where there is a lack of adult supervision.
Do not participate in discussions or any media that
arouse sexual feelings. Do not participate in any type of
pornography. The Spirit can help you know when you
are at risk and give you the strength to remove yourself
from the situation. Have faith in and be obedient to the
righteous counsel of your parents and leaders.

“Homosexual and lesbian behavior is a serious sin.

If you find yourself struggling with same-gender
attraction or you are being persuaded to participate in
inappropriate behavior, seek counsel from your parents
and bishop. They will help you.

“Victims of sexual abuse are not guilty of sin and do
not need to repent. If you have been a victim of abuse,
know that you are innocent and that God loves you.
Talk to your parents or another trusted adult, and seek
your bishop’s counsel immediately. They can support
you spiritually and assist you in getting the protection
and help you need. The process of healing may take
time. Trust in the Savior. He will heal you and give you
peace.

“Tf you are tempted to commit any form of sexual
transgression, seek help from your parents and bishop.
Pray to your Father in Heaven, who will help you resist
temptation and overcome inappropriate thoughts and
feelings. If you have committed sexual transgression,
talk to your bishop now and begin the process of
repentance so that you can find peace and have the full
companionship of the Spirit.

“Make a personal commitment to be sexually pure.
By your words and actions, encourage others to do
the same” (For the Strength of Youth, 35-37).

Ponder what message you feel the Lord would have
you focus on from what you just read.

Alma 39:7-19
Alma encourages Corianton to repent

Imagine having a conversation with your parents,
Young Men or Young Women leaders, or your bishop
or branch president about the importance of sexual
purity. Consider how you might respond to your
parents or Church leaders as they counsel you about
the importance of remaining sexually pure. Read Alma
39:7-8 to find what Alma’s purpose was in teaching
Corianton about the seriousness of his sin. Ponder
how your response to your parents’ or Church leaders’
counsel would be affected by knowing it was a loving
invitation to remain pure or repent and to avoid the
judgments of God.

198

Elder D. Todd Christofferson of the
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
described why parents, like Alma, invite
their children to repent: “The invitation
to repent is an expression of love... . If
we do not invite others to change or if
we do not demand repentance of ourselves, we fail
in a fundamental duty we owe to one another and
to ourselves. A permissive parent, an indulgent friend,
a fearful Church leader are in reality more concerned
about themselves than the welfare and happiness of
those they could help. Yes, the call to repentance is at
times regarded as intolerant or offensive and may
even be resented, but guided by the Spirit, it is in
reality an act of genuine caring” (“The Divine Gift

of Repentance,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2011, 39).

2. Write the following in your scripture study journal:

Repentance includes . . . Then, as you study Alma 39:9-
14, make a list in your scripture study journal of what Alma
taught Corianton about repentance that could help complete this
statement.

Use the following questions and commentary to

help you understand and apply Alma’s counsel. Try

to identify and write at least one truth for each verse
listed below that could help complete the statement in
your scripture study journal. You do not need to answer
the questions in your scripture study journal.

Read Alma 39:9. (Alma 39:9 is a scripture mastery
verse. You may want to mark it in a distinctive way so
you can locate it in the future.) What do the phrases
“go no more after the lusts of your eyes” and “cross
yourself in these things” have to do with forsaking sin?

In our day, the phrase “lusts of your eyes” has a strong
application to immorality and images or entertainment
that is pornographic in any way. The phrase “cross
yourself,” as used in Alma 39:9, means to deny yourself
of something. This phrase is not as familiar to us today.
However, in Joseph Smith’s day, some meanings

of the verb cross were “to erase; to cancel... . To
counteract ...; to stop” (Noah Webster's First Edition

of an American Dictionary of the English Language,
facsimile ed. [1967]). If we apply these definitions to
what Alma was teaching his son, we can understand
the importance of removing all aspects of immortality
(including sources of temptation of immorality that are
in our control) from our lives, that we might “inherit
the kingdom of God.” What are some ways young
Latter-day Saints today can draw a line for themselves
in matters of sexual purity and avoid going after the
lusts of their eyes?
Read Alma 39:10. How can seeking spiritual
nourishment—from parents, Church leaders, siblings,
or trusted friends—help someone repent?

Read Alma 39:11-12, and ponder the following
questions:

e What has to change in a person’s heart during the
repentance process so that he or she will not be led
away again by the devil to commit sin?

e How can avoiding the pursuit of vain and foolish
things help someone repent?

Read Alma 39:13. Recall that Alma told Corianton that
when the Zoramites had seen Corianton’s conduct
they wouldn’t believe Alma’s words (see Alma 39:11).
It might be helpful to understand that in the scriptures,
the phrase “turn to the Lord” denotes repentance.
Repentance is “a turning of the heart and will to God”
(Bible Dictionary, “Repentance”).

e What do you think it means to repent with all your
“mind, might, and strength”?

e When our sins affect others, what must we do as a
part of our repentance?

e When a serious sin is committed, why is it necessary
to seek a bishop or branch president’s help?

From Alma 39:9-13 we learn: Repentance includes
acknowledging and forsaking our sins and turning
to the Lord with all our mind, might, and strength.

Ponder what you feel the Lord would want you to do
to more fully turn your heart and will to Him. What
can you do today to begin acting on these promptings?

Without Jesus Christ and His Atonement, it would not
be possible for you to be forgiven of your sins. Read
Alma 39:15-16, 19, and look for how Alma described
the knowledge that Jesus Christ would come to take
away the sins of the world.

3. In your scripture study journal, write about why the
coming of Jesus Christ is good news for Corianton and
for you.

CL] Scripture Mastery—Alma 39:9

Elder Richard G. Scott of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles said the following about memorizing
scriptures:

“Learning, pondering, searching, and memorizing
scriptures is like filling a filing cabinet with friends,
values, and truths that can be called upon anytime,
anywhere in the world.

“Great power can come from memorizing scriptures.
To memorize a scripture is to forge a new friendship.
It is like discovering a new individual who can help in
time of need, give inspiration and comfort, and be a
source of motivation for needed change” (“The Power
of Scripture,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2011, 6).

4. Try to memorize Alma 39:9. In your scripture study

journal, write a sentence or two about how memorizing
this verse could be a protection to you in a moment of
temptation.

5. Write the following at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture study journal:

Alma 40-41

Introduction

As recorded in Alma 40-41, Alma taught his son
Corianton important doctrines related to life after
death. Alma explained that through Jesus Christ’s
Atonement, all mankind would be resurrected.
Alma also taught Corianton about the spirit world
where the dead, depending on their choices in
mortality, wait in paradise or in spirit prison until
the resurrection. Corianton learned from Alma that
the plan of restoration included not only physical
resurrection, but also a spiritual restoration in which
we receive the consequences for our actions and
desires. Finally, Alma emphasized that central to this
plan of restoration is the truth that wickedness can
never lead to real happiness.

Alma 40
Alma teaches Corianton about the spirit world and the
resurrection

Imagine that you have a friend who has recently
experienced the death of a loved one. Your friend,
knowing that you are religious, has come to you with
the following questions:

e What makes it possible for us to live again? Who
will be resurrected?

e Where do we go after we die, and what is it like?

199
¢ What is the resurrection? What is the difference
between our mortal bodies and our resurrected
bodies? What happens after we are resurrected?

The information in Alma 40 can help answer these
questions. This chapter is a continuation of Alma’s
teachings to his son Corianton. Corianton had become
concerned about the resurrection of the dead.

1. Read all three of the following scripture passages.

Choose one or more of the passages, and explain in your
scripture study journal how what Alma taught answers the
associated question. (If you have time at the end of the lesson,
you may want to come back and review what Alma taught in the
other verses.)

a. Study Alma 40:1-5. What makes it possible for us to live
again? Who will be resurrected?

b. Study Alma 40:6-7, 11-14. Where do we go after we die, and
what is it like? (When Alma taught that the spirits of all men are
“taken home to that God who gave them life” (Alma 40:11), he
was teaching that after our death, but before our resurrection,
our spirits will return to the world of spirits, not to the final
destination after God's judgment. It may be useful to consult the
footnotes in verse 13 to understand what Alma meant when he
referred to “outer darkness.” Alma 40:14 also helps us
understand that this reference to outer darkness is referring to a
pre-resurrection state we usually call spirit prison and not to the
final or permanent location of those who are damned.)

c. Study Alma 40:21-26. What is resurrection? What is different
between our mortal bodies and our resurrected bodies? What
happens after we are resurrected?

Referring to Alma 40:11-12, President George OQ.
Cannon of the First Presidency explained that Alma

200

“does not intend to convey the idea that they are
immediately ushered into the personal presence of
God. He evidently uses that phrase in a qualified
sense” (Gospel Truth: Discourses and Writings of
President George Q. Cannon, sel. Jerreld L. Newquist,
2 vols. [1957-74], 1:73).

Elder Neal A. Maxwell of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles described some of what we will experience
after we are resurrected:

“At the Judgment Day .. . there will be inclusive
objectivity. Not only will we have what the Book

of Mormon calls ‘bright recollection’ and ‘perfect
remembrance’ of our misdeeds, but the joyous things
will be brought forward and restored too. We shall
know ‘even as we know now,’ (Alma 5:18; 11:43; see
also D&C 93:33.) We shall see ‘eye to eye’ (Mosiah
12:22; 15:29) because of a shared database.

“Among the ‘all things [that] shall be restored’

(Alma 40:23) will be memory, including, eventually,
our premortal memories. Consider the joy of being
conjoined in mind and heart by the relevant memories
of both the first and the second estates.

“What a flood of feeling will come to us then, when
a loving God deems it wise that memories be fully
restored! This refreshing flood of fact will further
increase our gratefulness for how far back God’s
long-suffering goes and for the loving-kindness of
Jesus’ voluntary atonement!” (Lord Increase Our Faith
[1994], 103).

Resurrection is the reuniting of the spirit and the
body, with all things restored to their proper and
perfect frame. After the resurrection we will each
stand in God’s presence to be judged. Read Alma
40:25-26, and find Alma’s description of the final
state of those who choose righteousness in this life
as compared to the final state of those who choose
wickedness. Consider how this passage can affect your
desire to be clean before God.

As recorded in Alma 40:16-22, the resurrection Alma
spoke of was in relation to earthly time. Jesus Christ
was the first to be resurrected, followed shortly
thereafter by the righteous who had lived and died
from the time of Adam down to the time of Christ’s
Resurrection (see Alma 40:16, 20; D&C 133:54-55).
This resurrection is what Alma referred to as the “first
resurrection.”

Alma 41
Alma teaches Corianton about the plan of restoration

Considering the truths Alma taught about resurrection,
the spirit world, and the judgment, think about how it
might affect a person’s actions if he or she believed the
following:

e There is no life after death.

e After we die, we will be made perfect regardless of
whether our works were good or evil on earth.

e In the judgment we will be rewarded for our good
deeds and punished for our bad deeds.

In Alma 41 we learn that Corianton was confused

by what some people were teaching about the
resurrection. Consider marking the phrase “gone far
astray” in Alma 41:1, and then read this verse looking
for what caused some people to go astray. To help
you understand this verse, it may be helpful for you
to know that to wrest the scriptures means to twist,
distort, or change the meaning of the scriptures.

What concept did Alma say he is going to clarify for
Corianton?

Restoration means to bring back again. Alma wanted
Corianton to understand that there is a physical

and a spiritual aspect to what he called “the plan of
restoration” (Alma 41:2). Search Alma 41:2-5, and
mark what will be physically restored to us after death
and what will be spiritually restored. (Requisite in these
verses means required or necessary.)

What is the physical aspect of the plan of restoration
mentioned in Alma 41:2?

The spiritual aspect of the plan of restoration described
in Alma 40:3—5 is: We will be restored to either

happiness or misery according to our works and
desires in mortality.

2. Suppose that you have been asked to teach Alma

40:3—5 to a Primary class. Write in your scripture study
journal how you would explain the doctrine of spiritual
restoration in a simple way so that children could understand
what Alma taught.

Ponder how an understanding of the doctrine of
restoration can and should influence your actions and
desires.

As we come to understand the doctrine of restoration,
we naturally begin to worry about the consequences
that will come because of our sins and wrong choices.
Is there any way to change the negative consequences
of our wrong desires and actions? Alma offered
Corianton a reason to hope. Read Alma 41:6-9,

and look for what we can do to have goodness and
happiness restored to us even when we have seriously
sinned. You may want to mark words or phrases in
Alma 41:6-7 that suggest we are responsible for
what we receive in the resurrection. Think about the
following question: Based on these verses, in what
sense are we our own judge?

There are those who think they can return to God
without taking personal responsibility for their
actions. They often claim that their sinful choices are
fun. Sometimes those who engage in sin may even
appear to be happy. But read Alma 41:10, and look for
what Alma taught about wickedness. (Alma 41:10 is a
scripture mastery passage. You may want to mark it in
a distinctive way so you can locate it in the future.)

3. In Alma 41:10, Alma testified to his son that
“wickedness never was happiness.” Complete the
following assignments in your scripture study journal:
a. Write about why you believe Alma’s statement is true.
b. Write an example of how Satan might try to persuade us to
believe that we can break God's commandments and still be
happy.

Consider writing the following statement from
President Ezra Taft Benson in your scriptures next to
Alma 41:10: “You cannot do wrong and feel right. It is
impossible!” (“A Message to the Rising Generation,”
Ensign, Nov. 1977, 30).

Alma 41:11 explains why it is impossible to be truly
happy when choosing wrong. To help you understand
this verse, complete the chart below by matching each
scriptural phrase with its meaning. (When you are
finished, check your answers with those at the end of
the lesson.)

201
Words or phrases from Alma
41:11 that describe being in
“a state of nature”

Meaning

A. Limited and burdened
by our sins

1. “Ina carnal state”

___2. “In the gall of bitterness
and in the bonds of
iniquity”

B. Lacking the
companionship of the
Holy Spirit

____ 3. “Without God in the
world”

C. Ruled by the will of
the fles

Now that you have defined these terms, read Alma
41:11 again to identify why it is impossible to be
happy while choosing the wrong. Some who choose
wickedness may think they are happy at the moment,
but their choices will ultimately lead to sorrow and
unhappiness.

4. In your scripture study journal, answer the following
questions:

a. Why do you think that being in “a state of nature,” or a
sinful or “carnal state,” is contrary to the nature of happiness?

b. What are some examples of why young people may find
themselves lacking the companionship of the Holy Spirit, being
limited or burdened by their sins, or being ruled by the flesh?

Read Alma 41:12, and look for the question Alma
asked Corianton about restoration. Now read Alma
41:13, and mark how Alma answered this question.

5. Imagine speaking to a friend who wants to be happy

but is choosing to act in ways contrary to the Lord’s
commandments. Using the doctrine of restoration that you have
studied today, explain in your scripture study journal why he or
she is not experiencing happiness and what must be done to
become truly happy.

A boomerang is a tool that was originally used for
hunting. Because of its shape, when it is
thrown correctly, it returns to the
person who threw it. Read
Alma 41:14-15, looking
for how a boomerang
might symbolize the
truths taught in these
verses. You may want

to mark the phrase “send
out” in verse 15. Consider a
time when you have sent out
goodness or mercy or kindness and
received it back.

202

What is one righteous action you would like to send
out to others or a righteous attitude you would like
others to see in you that you would like to receive back
from others? What goal could you set to “send out”
one of these attitudes or actions?

C2) Scripture Mastery—Alma 41:10

6. Read Alma 41:10, and write the following in your

scripture study journal: /f wickedness never was happiness,
then will always lead to happiness. Write a word
in the blank that best completes the sentence. Now list a number
of specific righteous acts that you feel would also fit in the blank
(for example, serving others). Write your testimony of how you
have seen some of these righteous acts lead to happiness.

It is important to understand that the happiness that
comes from righteousness is not always immediate,
constant, or continuous here in mortality. However,
peace and happiness will always come in the Lord’s
way and time to an individual who is in harmony with
His teachings and commandments.

Alma 42

Introduction

Alma concluded his counsel to his struggling son
Corianton by explaining that Heavenly Father provided
a way for those who sin to obtain mercy. He taught
his son about the punishments that the law of justice
demands for sin. He then testified that Jesus Christ
would “appease the demands of justice” (Alma 42:15)
by suffering for all who have sinned and are willing

to repent. The Lord provides mercy to the penitent
(repentant).
Alma 42:1-14
Alma teaches Corianton about the law of justice

Close your eyes for a moment and ponder what it
might be like when the time arrives for your Final
Judgment. As you review your life, do you want the
Final Judgment to be fair? Why might you want your
judgment to be fair?

Now, consider what the word fair means. One definition
of fair includes getting what you deserve; the idea of
fairness is related to the scriptural term justice.

1. Draw a simple set of scales in your scripture study
journal like the one shown here. Then write the word

Justice below your drawing. Leave room in your journal to
include other labels on your drawing as you continue the lesson.

To help you better understand the concept of justice,
read the following explanation from Elder Dallin H.
Oaks of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles:

“Justice has many meanings. One is
balance. A popular symbol of justice is
scales in balance. ...

“... The idea of justice as what one
deserves is the fundamental premise of
all scriptures that speak of men’s being
judged according to their works” (“Sins, Crimes, and
Atonement” [address to CES religious educators,
Feb. 7, 1992], 1).

Alma’s son Corianton was worried about the fairness
of the Final Judgment. Read Alma 42:1, and mark what
Corianton thought would be unfair or unjust about the
Final Judgment.

Remember that Corianton had committed various sins,
some of which were very serious (see Alma 39:2-3);
therefore, Corianton may have wished or hoped that it
was unjust for those who have sinned to be punished.

2. In your scripture study journal, write why you think
those who have not repented of their sins would worry
about receiving “what one deserves” at the judgment.

In Alma 42:2-11, Alma addressed Corianton’s concern
by explaining that the Fall of Adam brought about
physical death (a separation of the body and spirit at
the death of the body) and spiritual death (a separation
from God because of sin). Thus it was necessary that
a plan be established to reclaim mankind from their
fallen state. Otherwise all mankind would remain in a
sinful state and be miserable forever according to the
demands of justice.

Read Alma 42:12, and identify what caused mankind to
enter their fallen state. Now read Alma 42:14, and mark
the consequence of our disobedience that is required by
justice. On the picture of the scales that you drew in your
scripture study journal, write Violation—disobedience or
sin under the left scale and Penalty—cut off from God's
presence under the right scale.

3. Read Alma 42:18. In your scripture study journal,
answer the following questions:

a. What do you think it means to have “remorse of conscience”
(Alma 42:18)?

b. What might remorse of conscience lead us to do?

From what Alma taught, what does the law of justice
require when an individual is disobedient? (Because
of our disobedience, the law of justice requires that
we experience remorse and be cut off from God’s
presence.) Ponder for a moment a time when you
experienced regret and sorrow or a withdrawal of the
Holy Ghost for something you did wrong. Imagine
that feeling multiplied by everything you have ever
done wrong, and then imagine that feeling remaining
with you forever.

Based on what Alma taught, do you want the Final
Judgment to be based solely on justice? Do you want
to get what you “deserve” for the things you have
done wrong?

Alma 42:15-31
Alma teaches Corianton about the plan of mercy

One of God’s divine attributes is that He is just. The
demands of justice condemn each of Heavenly Father's
children and would not allow any of us to dwell with
Him in our sinful state. Consider the following question:
Is there any way for these demands of justice to be
erased or dismissed?

203
Many people might respond to this question by
suggesting that if we repent, we will not have to suffer
the consequences of our sins. Though this answer is
ultimately correct, it is important to understand that

to erase or forgive the consequences would be unjust
because the demands of justice would not be met. Alma
taught that dismissing the penalty without satisfying
the demands of justice is not possible. Read Alma
42:25, and look for what would happen if God simply
removed the consequences for sin and left justice

unsatisfied.

Ponder the following question before reading Alma
42:15 to find the answer: If the punishment for our sins
cannot be taken away, how can we ever have peace of
conscience and be restored to the presence of God?

Pondering a Question

Bx
Pondering questions as you
study the scriptures requires
you to think, which in turn
stimulates your desire to
search the scriptures for
answers. Consider writing
down some of your own ques-
tions to ponder as you study
the scriptures. Pondering the
scriptures will increase your
ability to understand prin-
ciples and truths and apply
them to your own life.

It may be helpful to
understand that the
phrase “appease the
demands of justice”
means to satisfy or pay
for the punishments
justice demands.

From Alma 42:15 we
learn: Jesus Christ’s
Atonement satisfied
the demands of justice
so that mercy could

be extended to the
repentant. Complete the
picture of the scales you
drew in your scripture
study journal by writing

Satisfied by mercy—the Atonement of Jesus Christ under

the “Penalty...” phrase.

4. Imagine you have a friend who has been struggling

under the burden created by his or her sins. In your
scripture study journal, write how you would explain to your
friend how Jesus Christ's Atonement allows mercy to be

extended to each of us.

Ponder what it means to you to know that the Savior
willingly suffered the punishments justice demands in
your place so that you could be extended mercy?

Read Alma 42:22—24, and mark what Jesus Christ
requires in order for mercy to be extended to us. The
phrase “truly penitent” in verse 24 means sincerely
repentant. Based on what you have read, complete
the following principle: If we repent, we will receive
through the Atonement of Jesus

Christ.

204

President Boyd K. Packer, President of the Quorum

of the Twelve Apostles, referred to Jesus Christ as a
mediator. A mediator is one who stands between two
parties to help resolve a conflict. As you read his words,
look for how the Savior is needed for mercy to be
extended to the sinner:

“By eternal law, mercy cannot be
extended save there be one who is both
willing and able to assume our debt and
pay the price and arrange the terms for
our redemption.

“Unless there is a mediator, unless we
have a friend, the full weight of justice untempered,
unsympathetic, must, positively must fall on us. The
full recompense for every transgression, however
minor or however deep, will be exacted from us to the
uttermost farthing.

“But know this: Truth, glorious truth, proclaims there is
such a Mediator. . . .

“Through Him mercy can be fully extended to each of
us without offending the eternal law of justice. ...

“The extension of mercy will not be automatic. It will
be through covenant with Him. It will be on His terms,
His generous terms” (“The Mediator,” Ensign, May
1977, 55-56).

As Alma concluded his talk with Corianton, he

summarized everything he had been trying to teach
his son. Read Alma 42:26-31, and mark what Alma
desired for Corianton as he came to understand the

doctrines and principles Alma taught him in this
chapter. Notice Alma’s desire for Corianton to not
make excuses for his sins, but rather for him to allow
the doctrines and principles related to justice, mercy,
and the Atonement to “have full sway in [his] heart”
(Alma 42:30). How can you allow these doctrines and
principles to have full sway in your heart?
5. In your scripture study journal, write your thoughts

about the following question: If you could personally
express your gratitude to the Savior for His sacrifice on your
behalf, what would you tell Him?

It is important to know that Corianton repented and
ultimately had a great impact on the growth of the
Church (see Alma 49:30).

Alma 43-44

Introduction

In Alma 43-44, Mormon began to write about the
wars between the Lamanites and Nephites. As Alma
and his sons continued to minister to the people, the
Zoramites joined with the Lamanite army to attack
the Nephites. Captain Moroni demonstrated faith
and wisdom in defending the Nephites against the
Lamanite army. Even though they were outnumbered,
the Nephite army’s preparation and their faith in Jesus
Christ gave them the advantage in battle. When they
knew they would be defeated, the Lamanites made a
covenant of peace and departed out of the land fora
season.

Alma 43

Captain Moroni’s preparations and strategies help frustrate
the designs of the Lamanite army

1. In your scripture study journal, write a list of some

of your plans, goals, and desires for your future. As you
write, consider including spiritual goals and desires, such as a
mission, temple marriage, and family.

After you are done writing your list, identify the
desires and goals you feel Satan would not want
you to accomplish. As you study Alma 43-44, look
for principles that will help you accomplish your
righteous goals despite the efforts of the adversary
to prevent your success.

In Alma 43:1—4, despite Alma’s efforts to bring the
Zoramites back into the Church, many of them

joined the Lamanites in their preparation to attack

the Nephites. Read Alma 43:5-8, and identify the
“designs” (plans) of the Lamanite leader Zerahemnah.
You may wish to mark Zerahemnah’s intentions as you
discover them. Ponder how Zerahemnah’s designs or
desires for the Nephites may be like the designs Satan
might have for you.

Next read Alma 43:9-11, and identify the designs or
desires of the Nephites. Now ponder how these desires
may be similar to the righteous desires you have.

Captain Moroni, the chief captain of the Nephite
armies, prepared his people to defend their land and
families from the evil intentions of Zerahemnah. Read
Alma 43:16-19, looking for what preparations Captain
Moroni and the Nephites made.

2. In your scripture study journal, draw two of the things
that Moroni gave to his men to prepare them for war.

Now read Alma 43:20-22 to discover how the
Lamanites reacted to the Nephite preparations. Ponder
why the Lamanites withdrew their attack even though
they outnumbered the Nephites.

205
As we study the accounts of physical battles in the
Book of Mormon, we can liken them to the spiritual
battles we face.

3. Answer the following question in your scripture study

journal: What can you learn from Moroni’s preparations
for war about defending yourself against Satan’s attacks and
temptations?

After the Lamanites retreated, Moroni did not know
where his enemies would attack next. If you were
Moroni, what might you do to try to prepare for
another attack?

Read Alma 43:23-24 to find out what Moroni did.

From Moroni’s example we learn: If we seek and
follow prophetic counsel, we will be better able to
defend ourselves against the adversary. Just as the
prophet Alma was able to tell Moroni how to defend
the Nephites against their enemies, the Lord’s prophets
today teach us how to defend ourselves against the
spiritual attacks of the adversary.

4. In your scripture study journal, write a few sentences

about what prophetic counsel has been given in the latter

days that, if you heed it, can help you defend yourself from
Satan’s designs and temptations.

As recorded in Alma 43:25-43, Moroni acted on the
knowledge he received from the prophet by dividing
his army and hiding them along the path of the
oncoming Lamanites. As the Lamanites approached,
one half of the Nephite army attacked and drove the
Lamanites to the river Sidon. After the Lamanites
crossed the river, the other half of the Nephite

army attacked. When the Lamanites saw they were
surrounded, they fought so ferociously that the
Nephites began to falter.

You can learn principles about how to accomplish
your righteous goals and desires from studying
the remainder of Alma 43. Read Alma 43:43-54,
and contrast the sources of strength for both the
Lamanites and Nephites.

Ponder what was better about the cause the Nephites
were fighting for than the Lamanites’ cause. As we
compare Moroni and his faithful army to our battles
with the adversary, we learn that as we pray for help
in accomplishing our righteous plans and desires,
God will help us accomplish them.

206

5. In your scripture study journal, write about a time
when you experienced the Lord's help in accomplishing
your righteous goals.

Alma 44

After the Nephite victory, Captain Moroni commands the
Lamanites to make a covenant of peace

Recall that in Alma 43 when Captain Moroni saw
that the Lamanites were encircled and terrified, he
commanded his men to stop fighting. Read Moroni’s
words in Alma 44:1-6, and look for whom Moroni
credited the Nephite victory.

6. Based on Moroni's testimony in Alma 44:4—6, write a
truth in your scripture study journal that could help you
face your spiritual battles.
President Boyd K. Packer, President of the Quorum
of the Twelve Apostles, promised the youth that the
Lord would protect them as they remain faithful. As
you read his words, highlight those parts that are
comforting to you and that you feel apply to you.

“Youth today are being raised in enemy
territory with a declining standard of
morality. But as a servant of the Lord, I
promise that you will be protected and
shielded from the attacks of the adversary
if you will heed the promptings that come
from the Holy Spirit.

“Dress modestly; talk reverently; listen to uplifting
music. Avoid all immorality and personally degrading
practices. Take hold of your life and order yourself to be
valiant. Because we depend so much on you, you will
be remarkably blessed. You are never far from the sight
of your loving Heavenly Father” (“Counsel to Youth,”
Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2011, 18).

In Alma 44:7-10, Zerahemnah declared that he did not
believe God was the source of the Nephites’ strength.
He offered to have the Lamanites give up their
weapons, but he refused to make a covenant of peace.
Read Moroni’s response in Alma 44:11. Consider why
you think it was important to Moroni to have the
Lamanites make a covenant of peace.

While many of the Lamanites made a covenant of
peace, Zerahemnah rallied the remainder of his men to
contend with Moroni’s army. As the Nephites fell upon
the Lamanites and began to slay them, Zerahemnah saw
that his army’s destruction was imminent and promised
to enter into a covenant of peace (see Alma 44:12-20).

7. In your scripture study journal, write how you will

apply some of the principles and truths you learned in
this lesson to protect yourself against the temptations and
attacks of the adversary and to accomplish your righteous desires
and goals.

8. Write the following at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture study journal:

Additional questions, thoughts, and insights | would like to share
with my teacher:

Alma 45-49

Introduction

After Alma gave his final instructions to his son
Helaman, he departed from the people of Nephi and
was never heard of again. During the difficult times
that followed for the Nephites, Helaman and Captain
Moroni became their spiritual and military leaders.
The Lamanite leader Amalickiah selfishly pursued his
unrighteous desires, using tactics that resembled those
of the devil. Captain Moroni prepared his people to be
faithful to God during those perilous times.

Alma 45

Helaman believes the words of his father Alma, and begins
his ministry

Recall an interview you have had with a parent or
priesthood leader. Think of the kinds of questions
you were asked. Before Alma departed out of the
land, he asked Helaman three important questions.
Read Alma 45:2-7, and identify and mark these
questions. (The “words” Alma referred to in verse 2
can be found in Alma 37:1.) Think about how you
would answer Alma’s questions: Do you believe in
the scriptures? Do you believe in Jesus Christ? Will
you keep the commandments?

After Helaman declared his testimony, Alma spoke to
him about the future of the Nephites. He prophesied
of their destruction and the destruction of any other
people who would ripen in iniquity on this chosen

207
land. Read Alma 45:16, and consider the following
truth in this verse: The Lord cannot look upon sin
with the least degree of allowance.

To help you understand this principle, remember that
through His Atonement, the Savior paid the price for
all our sins if we will repent and seek His forgiveness.
God cannot tolerate sin in any degree. However,
because the Savior was willing to suffer in our behalf,
we do not have to suffer for our sins if we repent.

Read Doctrine and Covenants 1:31-33. You may want
to write these verses as a cross-reference near Alma
45:16.

1. Respond to the following question in your scripture

study journal: What are your feelings about the Savior
when you think about His willingness to pay the price for your
sins?

As recorded in Alma 45:20-24, Helaman began his
ministry as the prophet of the Lord and leader of

the Church. He and other Church leaders appointed
priests and teachers throughout the congregations, but
because of contention and increasing pride the people
refused to listen to their leaders.

Alma 46

Captain Moroni rallies the righteous to defend their rights
and their religion

As recorded in Alma 46:1-7, some people who were
angry with Helaman and his brethren chose to

leave the Church and follow a wicked man named
Amalickiah, who wanted to be king. Read Alma
46:8-10, and look for the lessons Mormon wanted us
to learn from this dangerous situation.

To help defend the liberty of the people, Moroni, who
was the chief captain of the Nephite armies, tore his

coat and used a piece of it to make a “title of liberty”
to rally the people in defense of liberty.

Read Alma 46:12-13, and mark what Moroni wrote
on the title of liberty. Identify how he prepared to
present the title of liberty to the people. Ponder what
these verses teach you about Moroni’s character. Also
read Alma 48:11-13, 17-18 to gain more insight into
the character of Captain Moroni. You may want to
mark the characteristics of Moroni that you would
like to develop more fully in your own life.

2. In your scripture study journal, write about one or

more of Moroni’s characteristics from Alma 46:12-13 and
Alma 48:1 1-13, 17-18. Explain why you would like to have these
characteristics and how you can strive to develop them.

208

Read Alma 46:18—22, and look for how the people
responded to Moroni’s invitation to fight for liberty.
The covenant described in verse 20 is a special promise
that this group of Nephites made with God.

According to Alma 46:20, why did Moroni want the
Nephites to make a covenant with God that they
would defend their rights and their religion?

As recorded in Alma 46:28—37, the Nephites who
joined with Captain Moroni captured the army

of Amalickiah. However, Amalickiah and a few

others escaped and joined the Lamanites. Many of
Amalickiah’s followers who were captured entered
into the covenant to support freedom. Those who
would not do so were put to death. From the Nephites’
experience, we can learn this principle: When we are
valiant in keeping the commandments as Captain
Moroni did, God will strengthen and bless us.

Following the battle, Captain Moroni had the title of
liberty hoisted onto every Nephite tower as a “standard”
or reminder of what they had covenanted to fight for
and protect (see Alma 46:36).
In the For the Strength of Youth booklet, the First
Presidency said: “Our dear young men and young
women, we have great confidence in you. You are
beloved sons and daughters of God and He is
mindful of you. You have come to earth at a time

of great opportunities and also of great challenges.
The standards in this booklet will help you with the
important choices you are making now and will yet
make in the future. We promise that as you keep the
covenants you have made and these standards, you
will be blessed with the companionship of the Holy
Ghost, your faith and testimony will grow stronger,
and you will enjoy increasing happiness” ([2011], ii).

3. From what you learn in that message from the First
Presidency, answer the following questions in your
scripture study journal:
a. What are the promises made to you if you keep the gospel
covenants you have made and the standards in the For the
Strength of Youth booklet?
b. Look at the contents page of the For the Strength of Youth
booklet, and choose one of the standards in the booklet. How
has keeping this standard blessed your life, or how may it bless
your life in the future?

Alma 47

Amalickiah becomes king of the Lamanites through
betrayal and deception

What would you do if you were at war and someone
presented you with a book that revealed what your
enemy planned to do to destroy you and your family?
Alma 47 can provide some insight into the plans of our
enemy, the devil.

Alma 47 records the many deceptions that Amalackiah
used to become king of the Lamanites so that he could
lead the Lamanite army to war against the Nephites.
His ultimate desire was to bring all the Nephites into
bondage, with him as their king.

Amalackiah and his followers first went to the land

of Nephi, where the Lamanites lived. The king of the
Lamanites desired to go to battle against the Nephites,
but many of his people were afraid. So the king asked
Amalackiah to compel the fearful Lamanites to join
the battle. Amalickiah marched to the mountain refuge
where these people had fled, but he did not want to
help the king. He wanted to become the leader of the
fearful Lamanites by tricking their leader, Lehonti, into
coming down off his mountain refuge. Amalickiah
intended to kill Lehonti with poison after he came
down.

Study Alma 47:10-12. How many times did Amalickiah
tempt Lehonti to leave his place of safety? Also read

Alma 47:17-19. How did Amalickiah kill Lehonti after
he came down off the mountain?

Elder Robert D. Hales of the Quorum of
the Twelve Apostles taught that people
today may try to destroy our faith and
testimony by tempting us to leave our
places of spiritual safety and come into the
devil's territory: “In the Book of Mormon,
we read about Lehonti and his men camped upon a
mount. The traitorous Amalickiah urged Lehonti to
‘come down’ and meet him in the valley. But when
Lehonti left the high ground, he was poisoned ‘by
degrees’ until he died, and his army fell into
Amalickiah’s hands (see Alma 47). By arguments

and accusations, some people bait us to leave the high
ground. The high ground is where the light is. . . . It is
the safe ground. It is true and where knowledge is”
(“Christian Courage: The Price of Discipleship,” Ensign
or Liahona, Nov. 2008, 74).

4. Answer the following questions in your scripture study
journal:

a. What are a few ways that Satan seeks to get us to “come
down” from spiritual high ground?

b. Do you think that Satan tries to entice young people to lower
their standards “by degrees”? What is an example of how he
tries to do this?

c. What specific thing can you do to stay on spiritual high
ground? What gospel standard do you need to work on so that
you do not lower this standard “by degrees”?

As he did with Amalickiah, Satan seeks to destroy us
and entices us by degrees to lower our standards.

Alma 48-49

Captain Moroni inspires the Nephites to fortify themselves
physically and spiritually

While Amalickiah was trying to obtain power by
“fraud and deceit” (Alma 48:7) over the Lamanites
and the Nephites, Moroni was acting in very different
ways. Read Alma 48:7-10, and look for what Moroni
did when he knew that Amalickiah would soon lead
the Lamanite armies against the Nephites. You may
want to mark these ideas: (1) He prepared the people
to be faithful to God in times of difficulty (see verse 7).
(2) He helped the people strengthen areas in which
they were weak (see verses 8-9). (3) He prepared

the people to support and defend the “cause of
Christians,” or the Church (see verse 10).

Just as Moroni helped his people prepare for and
endure difficult times, Church leaders in our time give
us counsel to help us prepare for times of difficulty.

209
Consider writing the following truth in your scriptures
near Alma 48:7-10: As we follow the counsel of

the Lord’s servants, we will be prepared for life’s
difficulties.

The Lamanites initially planned to attack the city of
Ammonihah and then the city of Noah, which had
been weak Nephite cities. Read Alma 49:4—5 to see

the response of the Lamanites when they saw the
Nephites’ preparation at the city of Ammonihah. The
Lamanites decided not to attack the city because it was
so well prepared against attack. Read Alma 49:12-14 to
see the Lamanites’ response when they tried to attack
the city of Noah.

5. Take a few minutes to review several talks from the
most recent general conference (in the Ensign or
Liahona). |n your scripture study journal, summarize the counsel
given by one or more of the speakers. How can this counsel help
you prepare for times of difficulty in your life? How can you use

this counsel in your life?

6. Write the following at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture study journal:

Alma 50—52; 54—55

Introduction

Captain Moroni continued to help his people defend
themselves by fortifying their cities. The Nephites
were successful against the Lamanites until rebellion
and wickedness began to weaken them. Despite
Moroni’s efforts to unite and defend the people, the
Nephites lost many cities because of contention among
themselves. Eventually, Moroni, Teancum, and Lehi
recaptured the city of Mulek and defeated one of the
largest Lamanite armies. Ammoron, the wicked leader
of the Lamanites, attempted to negotiate an exchange
of prisoners, but Moroni freed the Nephite prisoners
without bloodshed. Moroni stood firm and did not
compromise with Ammoron and his followers.

210

Alma 50-51

The Nephites are strengthened and prospered when they
are obedient to the Lord and unified among themselves

Think of a time in your life when you struggled to
overcome a challenge, such as a temptation, a health
problem, a problem at school, or a relationship problem
with friends or family members. Did you wish you had
greater spiritual strength at that time?

President Henry B. Eyring of the First
Presidency said: “As the forces [of sin]
around us increase in intensity, whatever
spiritual strength was once sufficient will
not be enough. And whatever growth in
spiritual strength we once thought was
possible, greater growth will be made available to us.
Both the need for spiritual strength and the
opportunity to acquire it will increase at rates which
we underestimate at our peril” (“Always,” Ensign, Oct.
1999, 9).

The preparations the Nephites made for their battles
can help us learn this truth: If we prepare ourselves
spiritually, we can overcome the challenges of life.

Review Alma 50:1-6. What did the Nephites do to
build fortifications around their cities? Read Alma 50:7.
What else did the Nephites do to prepare for battle?

The Nephites built fortifications that gave them
strength in a time of great difficulty. We can follow
their example by building our spiritual strength now
so that we will have the strength we need in a time of
difficulty. Spiritual strength is built most effectively by
consistent, daily efforts. We become spiritually strong
through such things as regular scripture study, prayer,
attending Church meetings, fulfilling our callings,
expressing gratitude to God, serving others, and
listening to and heeding the counsel of our Church
leaders.

1. Complete the following statements in your scripture
study journal:

a. | can build greater spiritual strength by (list some things you
can do).

b. / will more consistently do (choose one item from the list you

just made) each day to build my spiritual
strength.

Read Alma 50:19-23, and look for how the Lord
blessed the Nephites who were faithful to Him despite
the difficult circumstances of their day. You may want
to write this principle near these verses: Faithfulness
to God brings blessings, even amid turmoil. Look
at Alma 50:21 to see what Mormon said caused the
Nephites to lose these blessings.
During the time that Captain Moroni was leading

the Nephites in their battles against the Lamanites,
Pahoran became the chief judge of the Nephites. He
was a righteous man, and he worked to establish peace
in the land. However, a group of Nephites desired to
change the Nephite laws so they would be ruled by

a king, not a system of judges. The matter was put to

a vote, and the people voted to keep their system of
judges. However, the “king-men” would not support
the voice of the people and refused to fight with the
other Nephites when the Lamanites came to battle.
Moroni had to lead his armies against the king-men to
force them to join the Nephites. This greatly weakened
the Nephites in their battles against the Lamanites (see
Alma 51:1-21).

Read Alma 51:22—27, and look for evidence that the
Lamanites were able to gain power over the Nephites
because of the contention with the king-men. Think
about this principle: Division and contention
destroy peace.

2. Read Alma 50:39—40 and Alma 51:22, and notice

how diligently Pahoran and Captain Moroni sought to
establish peace among their people. Think about a time in your
life when you have seen contention, whether among friends,
family members, school associates, or others. Also think about
the characteristics of someone who strives to establish peace.
Write in your scripture study journal about the characteristics a
peacemaker might have.

Alma 52

Moroni and Teancum work together to defeat the
Lamanites

As recorded in Alma 51:33-34, Amalackiah was

killed by Teancum, one of the Nephites’ greatest
military leaders. After Amalackiah’s death, his brother
Ammoron took command of the Lamanite armies.
Moroni gave Teancum instructions to continue to fortify
and protect the northern portion of the land Bountiful
and retake any Nephite cities then occupied by the
Lamanites, if possible (see Alma 52:1-10). Read Alma
52:15-17, and look for why Teancum decided not to
attack the city of Mulek.

Teancum knew that when the enemy was in his
stronghold, it would be hard to defeat him. From this
experience, we can learn this principle: If we avoid
the adversary’s strongholds, we are more able to
avoid and resist temptation.

3. What are some places that might be considered

strongholds of the adversary? (These are places or
situations where you might be influenced to sin if you went
there—for example, a party where people are drinking alcohol
or watching an inappropriate movie.) Write in your scripture
study journal a few such places. Also write why you think you
should avoid going to these places.

This was a difficult time for the Nephites because the
Lamanites had captured many Nephite cities while the
Nephites were fighting the king-men. The Lamanites
were using those cities as strongholds, so it was hard
for the Nephites to retake them. Moroni developed a
plan to get the Lamanites out of the city of Mulek so
that the Nephites could have the city again. Read Alma
52:21-26 to see what Moroni and Teancum did.

4. Write in your scripture study journal what Moroni and

Teancum did to capture the city of Mulek (see Alma 52:21-
26). Also write what you think about Moroni as a general. In what
ways was he a good general for the Nephites?

211
Alma 54-55

Moroni refuses to exchange prisoners with Ammoron
and retakes the city of Gid

Throughout the war between the Lamanites and the
Nephites, both sides had captured many prisoners of
war. The Lamanite leader Ammoron sent a letter to
Moroni, proposing that the two sides exchange their
prisoners. Moroni was happy to exchange prisoners
so that the captured Nephites could be returned and
so that his armies would not have to feed and care for
their Lamanite prisoners. (See Alma 54:1-2.)

However, as he and Ammoron exchanged letters,
Ammoron wrote demanding that the Nephites
surrender and let the Lamanites govern them. He
said that the Nephites were murderers and that the
Lamanites were justified in fighting them. He also
declared that there was no God. (See Alma 54:16-24.)

When Moroni received this letter, he knew that
Ammoron was lying. Ammoron knew that the
Lamanites did not have a righteous reason for fighting
the Nephites. Moroni said that he would not exchange
prisoners and give the Lamanites more strength. He
would find a way to rescue the Nephite prisoners
without trading for them. (See Alma 55:1-2.)

Read Alma 55:3-24 to find out what Moroni did to
rescue the Nephite prisoners.

When Moroni refused to give in to Ammoron’s
demands and found a way to rescue the Nephite
prisoners, he prevented the Lamanites from gaining a
great advantage over the Nephites and instead gained
great advantages for the Nephites. One truth we

can learn from Moroni’s example is this: If we trust
the Lord and obey Him with exactness, He will
support us in our struggles.

The story found in Alma 55:3-24 is a very exciting
story of rescue. Think of a family member or friend
who would enjoy hearing this story, and find a time
to tell the story to this person. You may also want
to share with this person the bold principle in the
paragraph above and explain how Moroni is an
example of this principle.

Alma 53; 56-58

Introduction

Helaman and Captain Moroni fought the Lamanites
in different parts of the land. Helaman sent a letter
to Moroni describing his armies’ battles with the
Lamanites and expressing his confidence and
satisfaction in the great faith of the 2,060 stripling
warriors. Because of the faith and courage of these
Nephite warriors, the Lord helped them win battles
and blessed them with assurance and hope during
their times of affliction.

Alma 53; 56

The armies of Antipus and Helaman defeat the strongest
army of the Lamanites

While Captain Moroni fought the Lamanites in one
part of the land, Helaman led his army in another
part of the land. Included in his army were 2,000
young sons of the people of Ammon. The parents of
these young men had made a covenant never to take
up arms against their enemies again, but their sons
had not made the covenant, so they could help the
Nephite armies (see Alma 53:10-18).

1. Draw the following diagram in your scripture study

journal. Read Alma 53:18-21, and look for phrases
describing the traits the 2,000 young men had developed before
their military service. List the phrases you discover under the
heading “Traits developed before battle.” You might want to
mark these phrases in your scriptures.

Traits demonstrated
during battle

Traits developed
before battle

Stripling Warrior—Young Latter-day Saint

Antipus, a Nephite military leader, was greatly
outnumbered by the Lamanite enemy as he and his
army defended their part of the land. Antipus rejoiced
when Helaman brought the 2,000 young warriors to
help him (see Alma 56:9-10).
In their first battle against the enemy, the 2,000 young
warriors led away the strongest army of the Lamanites,
and the Nephite commander Antipus ordered his
army to pursue the Lamanite army from behind. The
army of Antipus caught up with the Lamanite army,
who stopped to fight them. The stripling warriors, who
had continued forward, noticed that the Lamanites
had stopped pursuing them. They did not know if the
Lamanites had halted to trick them into returning so
they could be destroyed or if the Lamanites had stopped
because Antipus’s army had caught them from behind.
Therefore, Helaman did not know if they should turn
back and attack the Lamanites. (See Alma 56:29-43.)

Read Alma 56:43—-48, and look for phrases describing
traits these young men demonstrated at a critical time
during battle. List what you found in your scripture
study journal under the heading “Traits demonstrated
during battle.” You might also choose to mark these
phrases in your scriptures.

Study Alma 56:49, 54-56 to see what happened
when the 2,000 young warriors returned to battle the
Lamanites. Look for phrases that illustrate this truth:

When we act in faith, we can receive strength
from God.

2. Answer the following questions in your scripture study
journal:

a. How can developing the traits of the stripling warriors help
you act in faith when you face challenging situations?

b. Describe a time when you (or someone you know) acted in
faith and received strength from God to successfully handle a
difficult situation.

Alma 57
Helaman’s army retakes the cities of Antiparah and Cumeni

Helaman and his army were able to take the cities
Antiparah and Cumeni from the Lamanites. During
this time, Helaman received reinforcements to

his army. Thousands of warriors from the land of
Zarahemla joined the army, as did 60 more sons of
the people of Ammon (see Alma 57:1-12).

Soon after Helaman’s army captured the city of
Cumeni, the Lamanites attacked them again.
Helaman’s army faced a great struggle, in which the
2,060 stripling warriors were a great strength to the
entire army. Read Alma 57:19-21 to discover some
traits the stripling warriors exhibited in this battle.
You may want to add these traits to the list of “Traits
demonstrated during battle” in your scripture study
journal and mark them in your scriptures.

3. One of the defining characteristics of the stripling

warriors was that they obeyed “with exactness” (Alma
57:21). Answer the following questions in your scripture study
journal:

a. What do you think it means to obey a commandment “with
exactness”?

b. How do you think obeying their commander's words with
exactness helped the stripling warriors win their battle?

c. How would obeying the Lord’s commandments with
exactness help you in the spiritual battles you have in life?

Consider writing the following principle in your
scriptures or in your scripture study journal: As we
obey the Lord with exactness, He will strengthen
us in the battles we have in life. Read the following
statement by Elder Russell M. Nelson of the Quorum
of the Twelve Apostles, who explained why obeying
God’s commandments “with exactness” is so
important:

“TYou] will encounter people who pick which
commandments they will keep and ignore others that
they choose to break. I call this the cafeteria approach
to obedience. This practice of picking and choosing will
not work. It will lead to misery. To prepare to meet God,
one keeps all of His commandments. It takes faith

213
to obey them, and keeping His commandments will
strengthen that faith.

“Obedience allows God’s blessings to flow without
constraint. He will bless His obedient children with
freedom from bondage and misery. And he will bless
them with more light.

“~.. Obedience to the commandments of God will
provide physical and spiritual protection” (“Face
the Future with Faith,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2011,
34-35).

Read Alma 57:25-27, looking for some reasons why
the Lord extended His power to protect the stripling
warriors. What impresses you the most about the
stripling warriors in these verses?

Even when we are righteous, God will not always
protect us from difficulty. Even though the stripling
warriors were preserved from death, all of them were
wounded (see Alma 57:25), and many other righteous
Nephites were killed (see Alma 57:26). However, God
will always strengthen us during times of difficulty
and bless us with the things we need. Ultimately,

He will give eternal blessings to all who obey His
commandments.

214

Alma 58

Nephite armies wait for provisions and then retake the
city of Manti

In addition to the battles they fought with the
Lamanites, Helaman’s army faced another form

of adversity. Their battles were being fought some
distance from Zarahemla, which was the center of the
Nephite government. Helaman’s army had won some
very difficult battles, but they did not receive the food,
supplies, and additional soldiers they needed from the
government. They did not know why the government
was not supporting them. (See Alma 58:7—9.)

4. Read Alma 58:10-12, and answer the following
questions:

a. What did the Nephites do when they faced this difficult
situation?

b. How did the Lord respond to their sincere pleadings and
prayers?

c. According to Alma 58:12, how did the Lord’s assurances help
Helaman and his army?

Write the following principle in your scriptures or
scripture study journal: If we turn to God in times of
difficulty, we can receive divine assurance that can
strengthen our faith and give us hope.

Despite the weakness of his army, Helaman and his
men were able to capture the city of Manti (see Alma
58:13-41). Helaman attributed all the army’s successes
to the help of the Lord (see Alma 58:37).

Helaman continued to marvel at the success of the
stripling warriors. Study Alma 58:39-40, and look
for words and phrases that show the ways in which
the stripling warriors were valiant during difficult
circumstances. Consider marking these words or
phrases in your scriptures.

5. Write in your scripture study journal about a time
when you turned to God for help during a time of
difficulty and felt His support.

Alma 59-63

Introduction

Helaman wrote a letter to Captain Moroni, telling
him about the army’s efforts and asking for help
from the Nephite government. Captain Moroni
rejoiced in learning about Helaman’s successes, but
he was angry at the government for neglecting to
send reinforcements. Captain Moroni wrote a letter
of rebuke to the chief judge, Pahoran. In his reply,
Pahoran told of a rebellion against the government.
Moroni marched to his aid and defeated the rebels.
Then the Nephite armies were able to unitedly defeat
the Lamanites. After 14 years of war, the Nephites
again had peace in the land, allowing Helaman and
his brethren to focus on building up the Church.

Alma 59

The Nephites lose a stronghold, and Captain Moroni
grieves because of the wickedness of the people

When Captain Moroni received a letter from Helaman
describing his army’s successes, Moroni and his
people rejoiced. Moroni then sent a letter to Pahoran,
the Nephite leader in Zarahemla, asking him to

send reinforcements and provisions to Helaman. But
no reinforcements were sent. Therefore, when the
Lamanites attacked the city of Nephihah, the people
of Nephihah were forced to flee and the Lamanites
conquered the city.

Read Alma 59:9-12 to learn Moroni’s reaction to the
Lamanite victory. Consider marking in your scriptures
this phrase in Alma 59:9: “it was easier to keep the city
from falling into the hands of the Lamanites than to
retake it from them.” From this phrase, we can learn this
principle: It is easier and better to remain faithful
than it is to return to the faith after going astray.

1. Study the phrase you have marked in Alma 59:9 and
the bold principle in the previous paragraph. Answer the
following questions in your scripture study journal:

a. Why is it easier to avoid addictions to harmful substances
than to overcome an addiction?

b. Why is it easier to maintain a testimony than to regain it
after losing it?

c. Why might it be easier for a person to remain active in the
Church than to return to the Church from inactivity?

Alma 60-62

Moroni asks Pahoran about the cause of the government's
neglect

After the city of Nephihah was captured by the
Lamanites, Captain Moroni decided to write an appeal
to Pahoran, the chief judge in Zarahemla. Read Alma
60:17-24, and look for the accusations that Moroni
made about Pahoran and the people in Zarahemla.

Read Alma 60:23 again, and note Captain Moroni’s
reference to cleansing the “inward vessel” first. He
was referring to the need to remove corruption from
the Nephite government and its people. However, this
verse can apply to our lives as well. Imagine putting
dirt or mud on the inside of a cup. Even if you washed
the outside of the cup, would you feel comfortable
drinking from the cup?

2. Answer the following questions in your scripture study
journal:
a. If we think of ourselves as “vessels,” what do you think it
means to cleanse the inner vessel?

b. Why would cleansing our inner vessel help us be of greater
service in the Lord's kingdom?

As recorded in Alma 60:33-36, Captain Moroni

told Pahoran to quickly send men and provisions

to his army and to Helaman’s army. If Pahoran did

not, Moroni said he would lead a military force to
Zarahemla and force him to do these things. Pahoran
received Moroni’s letter and quickly wrote back to him.
Read Alma 61:1-5 to discover what was happening in
Zarahemla.

Read Alma 61:9-14, and think about how Pahoran
responded to Moroni’s accusations. Consider marking
those statements that reveal the greatness of Pahoran’s
character. Instead of taking offense, Pahoran invited
Moroni to unite with him in the strength of the Lord

215
to fight the enemy. Read Alma 62:1 to discover how
Moroni felt when he received Pahoran’s response.

Consider writing the following truths in your scripture
study journal: We can choose to not be offended by
the words or actions of others. When we unite in
righteousness with others, we are stronger in our
battles against evil.

Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles taught:

“Through the strengthening power of the
Atonement of Jesus Christ, you and I can
be blessed to avoid and triumph over
offense. ‘Great peace have they which
love thy law: and nothing shall offend
them’ (Psalm 119:165)....

“’.. Moroni... wrote to Pahoran ‘by the way of
condemnation’ (Alma 60:2) and harshly accused him
of thoughtlessness, slothfulness, and neglect. Pahoran
might easily have resented Moroni and his message,
but he chose not to take offense... .

“One of the greatest indicators of our own spiritual
maturity is revealed in how we respond to the
weaknesses, the inexperience, and the potentially
offensive actions of others. A thing, an event, or

an expression may be offensive, but you and I can
choose not to be offended—and to say with Pahoran,
‘it mattereth not’ [Alma 61:9]” (“And Nothing Shall
Offend Them,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2006, 90-91).

3. Think about a time when you chose not to be
offended by the words or actions of others. Write a short
paragraph about the importance of choosing not to be offended.

As recorded in Alma 62, Captain Moroni brought his
army to Zarahemla to help Pahoran overthrow the
king-men—Nephite dissenters who wanted to establish
a king and enter into an alliance with the Lamanites. The
king-men had prevented Pahoran from sending men
and supplies to the aid of Moroni and Helaman. Moroni
and Pahoran then united their forces and received help
from other Nephite armies to drive the Lamanites out of
the land. During this time many Lamanites repented and
joined the people of Ammon.

216

Imagine some of the challenges that might have
existed for families and individuals at the end of such
a war. Read Alma 62:39-41 to see how the Nephites
were affected by the trials of war. As you read, look for
truths you can identify in these verses.

Write the following principle or truth in your scriptures
by Alma 62: 39-41 or in your scripture study journal:
We can grow closer to the Lord during our trials.

4. Write answers to the following questions in your
scripture study journal:

a. Why do you think some people grow closer to the Lord when
faced with trials while others turn away from Him?

b. What have the chapters on war taught you about being a
disciple of Jesus Christ in times of difficulty or trial?

Alma 63

Many Nephites travel to the land northward

After Helaman died (see Alma 62:52), his brother
Shiblon took possession of the sacred records. Read
Alma 63:1-2 to see what kind of a man Shiblon was.
As recorded in Alma 63, Moroni and Shiblon died,
and Moroni’s son, Moronihah, took command of the
Nephite armies.

Read Alma 63:10—13. Before he died, Shiblon gave
Helaman, who was the son of Helaman, charge of the
sacred records. Helaman preserved the records that
were already written and began keeping the record
that would become the book of Helaman.

Alma 63:5-8 records that many Nephites traveled by
ship to lands northward and were never heard from
again. Also, the end of Alma 63 reveals that once

again there began to be some contention between the
Lamanites and the Nephites, thus ending the long and
inspiring book of Alma.

INTRODUCTION TO

Helaman

Why Study This Book?

In your study of the book of Helaman, you will learn
from the examples and teachings of great men such as
Helaman, Nephi, Lehi, and Samuel the Lamanite who
courageously obeyed the Lord and testified of Jesus
Christ. The ministries of these individuals demonstrate
that God grants power to help His servants accomplish
His will and that the efforts of righteous individuals
can bring blessings to thousands. You will also

learn about the consequences that follow pride,
wickedness, and secret combinations.

Who Wrote This Book?

Mormon compiled and abridged records from the
large plates of Nephi to create the book of Helaman.
The book is named for Helaman, the son of Helaman
and grandson of Alma the Younger. Helaman received
the records from his uncle, Shiblon, and served as a
righteous chief judge over the Nephites. He taught
his sons Nephi and Lehi to remember their Redeemer,
Jesus Christ (see Helaman 5:9-14). These teachings
later inspired Nephi to give up his position as chief
Judge in order to preach repentance to the Nephites
and Lamanites. After thousands of Lamanites were
converted, a Lamanite prophet named Samuel was
inspired to preach repentance and prophesy among
the Nephites at the same time as Nephi. The book

of Helaman draws from the records kept during the
governing and ministry of Helaman (Helaman 1-3)
and Nephi (Helaman 4-16). Nephi’s records included
the prophecies and teachings of Samuel the Lamanite.

When and Where Was It Written?

The original records used as sources for the book of
Helaman were likely written between 52 B.c. and 1 B.C.
Mormon abridged those records sometime between
A.D. 345 and A.D. 385. Mormon did not record where
he was when he compiled this book.

Helaman 1—2

Introduction

After the chief judge Pahoran died, there was a serious
contention among the Nephites about which of his
sons—Pahoran, Paanchi, and Pacumeni—should
become the new chief judge. Pahoran was elected by
the people as the new chief judge. One of Paanchi’s
followers, a man named Kishkumen who was acting
for a secret band, murdered Pahoran, and Pacumeni
was then appointed as chief judge. Taking advantage
of this contention and division, the Lamanites were
able to conquer the Nephites’ capital city of Zarahemla
and kill Pacumeni. The Nephite general Moronihah
regained the city of Zarahemla, and Helaman was
appointed as the chief judge. Kishkumen was slain
while attempting to kill Helaman, and Gadianton
became the leader of the secret band.

Helaman 1

Contention over who should be chief judge allows the
Lamanites to conquer Zarahemla, the capital city of the
Nephites

Think of the last time you had an argument with
someone or witnessed others having an argument.
What problems does such contention cause? As
you study Helaman 1, look for the problems that
contention brought upon the Nephites and ponder
what you can learn from their experience.

Read the following scripture passages, and write your
answers to the questions in the spaces provided:

¢ Helaman 1:1—4. What caused contention and
divisions among the Nephite people?

¢ Helaman 1:5-8. Who was appointed chief judge?
How did the two brothers of the new chief judge
react?

¢ Helaman 1:9-12. What did Kishkumen do, and what
covenant did Kishkumen and his secret band make

with each other?

217
During this time of contention among the Nephites, a
man named Coriantumr led the Lamanites against the
city of Zarahemla in battle. Read Helaman 1:18—22, and
identify what the Lamanites were able to do as a result
of the Nephites’ contention.

One of the truths we can learn from this account is:
Contention is divisive and makes us vulnerable to
the influence of the adversary. You may want to write
this principle in your scriptures next to Helaman 1:18.

1. To help you better understand this principle, answer
the following questions in your scripture study journal:

a. A young woman has been arguing with her parents about
her friends. How might this contention affect her attitude toward
listening to her parents’ counsel about other areas of her life?

b. A young man has angry feelings toward someone in his
priesthood quorum. How might this contention affect the way
he acts at church?

c. Think of an area in your life in which you feel there is
contention between you and other people. What is one specific
thing you can do to eliminate this contention from your life?
How can you accomplish this?

Helaman 1:22-30 records that after the Lamanites
conquered Zarahemla, they began immediately to
march toward the city of Bountiful in order to capture
it as well. The Nephite armies were able to surround
the Lamanites and defeat them. Many Lamanites were
slain, and those who surrendered were allowed to
return to their own lands.

Helaman 2

Helaman becomes chief judge, and his servant prevents
a secret band from taking his life

Before you study Helaman 2, think about how a
faithful young woman or young man would strive to
resolve a mistake or a sin. Would she or he try to cover
it up or seek forgiveness from the Lord and from those
who were hurt?

After Kishkumen murdered Pahoran, he and the
members of his secret band promised each other that
they would never tell anyone who had committed
the murder. Read Helaman 2:3-—4, and pay attention
to the phrase “entered into a covenant that no one
should know his wickedness.” Then read Doctrine and
Covenants 58:43, and look for how the Lord wants us
to act when we have done something wrong.

2. Based on your study of Helaman 2:3—4 and Doctrine
and Covenants 58:43, write in your scripture study

218

journal the differences between how the Lord wants us to act if
we commit a sin and how Kishkumen and his followers acted.

Helaman became the new chief judge after Pahoran’s
death, and then Kishkumen and his secret band
decided to kill Helaman as well. A man named
Gadianton became the leader of the secret band at
this time. Read Helaman 2:2-9, and write in the space
below how Kishkumen was killed:

Read Helaman 2:10-14, and look for what happened
to the Gadianton band of robbers. Mormon warned
that secret groups like the Gadianton robbers, which
were called “secret combinations” (see, for example,
Helaman 3:23), would ultimately cause the destruction
of the Nephite people. Previous Book of Mormon
prophets had also warned against embracing secret
combinations (see 2 Nephi 26:22; Alma 1:12). The
Book of Mormon teaches this principle: Secret
combinations can lead to the destruction of
societies.

Elder M. Russell Ballard of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles warned of the dangers of secret combinations
today. As you read his warning, mark what we can do
to stand against secret combinations.

“The Book of Mormon teaches that secret
combinations engaged in crime present a
serious challenge, not just to individuals
and families but to entire civilizations.
Among today’s secret combinations

are gangs, drug cartels, and organized
crime families. The secret combinations of our day
function much like the Gadianton robbers of the
Book of Mormon times... . Among their purposes

are to ‘murder, and plunder, and steal, and commit
whoredoms and all manner of wickedness, contrary
to the laws of their country and also the laws of their
God’ [Helaman 6:23].

“Tf we are not careful, today’s secret combinations can
obtain power and influence just as quickly and just as
completely as they did in Book of Mormon times... .

“The Book of Mormon teaches that the devil is the
‘author of all sin’ and the founder of these secret
combinations [Helaman 6:30]... . His purpose is to
destroy individuals, families, communities, and nations
[see 2 Nephi 9:9]. To a degree, he was successful during
Book of Mormon times. And he is having far too much
success today. That’s why it is so important for us... to
take a firm stand for truth and right by doing what we
can to help keep our communities safe.
“... [We can] ‘stand as witnesses of God’ by setting an
example, keeping Church standards, and sharing our
testimony with those around us [see Mosiah 18:9]”
("Standing for Truth and Right,” Ensign, Nov. 1997, 38).

Think of one or more ways you can apply Elder
Ballard’s teaching to stand for truth and right in your
community and in your country.

Helaman 3-4

Introduction

During the time described in the early chapters of
Helaman, the Nephites enjoyed periods of peace and
endured times of contention. Tens of thousands of
Nephites joined the Church during the time of peace.
Following this great prosperity, the more humble
members of the Church grew in their faith despite
being persecuted by those who became proud. Because
many Nephites became wicked, they lost all of their
southern lands to the Lamanites.

Helaman 3

Many Nephites migrate northward while the Church
prospers in the midst of wickedness and persecution

Read Helaman 3:1-2, and notice that for several years
there was “no contention” among the Nephite people.
Now read Helaman 3:3, 19, and identify words or
phrases that show things had changed among the
Nephites.

Helaman 3:4—16 explains that as contention grew
among the Nephites, many people moved northward.

Many Nephites became wicked and joined the
Lamanites.

Despite the contention and wickedness, Helaman
chose to live differently. Helaman was serving as the
chief judge of the Nephites and also as a prophet
among them. Read Helaman 3:20, and identify how
Helaman was described. (The word equity means
fairness or without bias or favoritism.)

What impresses you about Helaman? Why do you
think he remained so strong during this period of
contention and wickedness? You may want to mark
the word continually in Helaman 3:20.

Read Helaman 3:22-26, and mark how the Nephites
began to change for the better. How many people
joined the Church?

Mormon often used the phrases “thus we may see,”
“thus we see,” and “we see” to point out truths he
wanted us to learn. In Helaman 3:27—30 these phrases
are used a number of times, showing that Mormon
wanted us to learn some important lessons. Read
Helaman 3:27—30, and mark the key phrases and
identify the lessons Mormon wanted us to learn.

1. Complete the following assignments in your scripture
study journal:
a. Write what Mormon wanted you to know from Helaman
3:27-30 about the word of God.

b. Write how your study of the scriptures has helped you avoid
wickedness and kept you on a path toward the presence of God.

Read Helaman 3:32-34, and notice that some Church
members began to persecute other Church members.
The persecutors were people who said they belonged
to the Church, but they were actually filled with pride
and did not believe in the teachings of the Church.
Their actions caused the humble members of the
Church to suffer many afflictions. Consider how
difficult it would be to go to church and be persecuted
by other Church members because you chose to follow
God’s prophets and commandments.

Read Helaman 3:35 to learn how the faithful Church
members acted during their time of persecution and
affliction.

2. Based on your study of Helaman 3:35, answer the
following questions in your scripture study journal:
a. Did the faith of the humble Church members increase or
decrease during their time of affliction?

b. What did the humble Church members do that strengthened
their faith?

c. What blessings did these Church members receive?

By studying Helaman 3:33-35, we can learn that each
individual determines how persecution and affliction
will affect him or her. Finish this statement based
on what you learned from these verses: Despite
persecution and trial, our faith in Jesus Christ can
increase as we

. (There are a number of ways to complete this
sentence.) You may want to write your sentence in your
scriptures next to Helaman 3:33-35.

3. To help you better understand the teachings of these
verses, answer two or all of the following questions in
your scripture study journal:
a. How has prayer or fasting helped you in a time of
persecution or trial?

b. What do you think it means to yield your heart unto God?

c. When has your faith in Jesus Christ increased during a time
of persecution or trial?

Read Helaman 3:36—37, and identify the spiritual state
of most of the Nephites at the time when Helaman
died.

Helaman 4

The Spirit of the Lord withdraws from the Nephites, and
the Lamanites conquer all of the Nephites’ southern lands

As recorded in Helaman 4, after Helaman died, the
pride and contention among the Nephites caused
many Nephites to join the Lamanites. The Lamanites
fought a battle against the Nephites. Read Helaman
4:4-8, and mark on the map the territory you think
the Lamanites conquered.

4. Divide a page in your scripture study journal in half

by drawing a vertical line down the middle of the page.
On the top of one side of the page write: Phrases that show the
Nephites’ attitude and actions. On the other side of the page
write: Phrases that show what happened because of these
actions. Read Helaman 4:1 1-13, 21-26, and write at least three
phrases under each heading.

One of the important principles we learn from
Helaman 4 is this: Pride and wickedness separate us
from the Spirit of the Lord and leave us to our own
strength. You may want to write this principle in your
scriptures next to Helaman 4:23-25.

220

In the Nephites’ experience, being left to their own
strength usually meant losing battles and their lands
(see Helaman 4:25—26). In our lives, being left to our
own strength can mean losing the companionship of
the Spirit.

5. Think about what “battles” you face in your life, and

write about one or more of them in your scripture study
journal. Write at least one thing you can do to maintain the
companionship of the Spirit in your life. Also write your feelings
about the importance of having the Spirit in your life to help you
face your life’s battles with the strength of the Lord.

Helaman 5

Introduction

The Nephites continued in wickedness until the
majority of them chose evil rather than righteousness.
Inspired by the words of their father, Nephi and
Lehi devoted themselves to preaching the gospel.
Their father, Helaman, had taught them about the
importance of building their lives on the foundation
of the Savior. After teaching the Nephites, Lehi and
Nephi preached to the Lamanites and were thrown
into prison. After the Lord miraculously delivered
Nephi and Lehi from prison, the majority of the
Lamanites converted to the gospel.

Helaman 5:1-13

Helaman taught his sons Nephi and Lehi to remember the
commandments of God and Jesus Christ's power to help
them

Read the following six words and phrases. To help you
complete the next activity, try to remember each one
of them. You will be asked to write them from memory
in your scripture study journal: family, parents, the
Atonement of Jesus Christ, prophets, repentance leads to
salvation, keep the commandments.

1. Close your manual, and write these six words or
phrases in your scripture study journal from memory.

Check your answers. Think for a moment if it was easy
or hard to remember the phrases. Do you think it made
a difference that you were told that you would be
asked to write the items from memory?

Read the following statement from
President Spencer W. Kimball and think
about why remember is such an important
word when we are trying to live the gospel:
“When you look in the dictionary for the
most important word, do you know what
it is? It could be remember. Because all of you have made
covenants—you know what to do and you know how
to do it—our greatest need is to remember” (“Circles
of Exaltation” [address to Church Educational System
religious educators, June 28, 1968], 5).

Today you will study about two people who made a
difference in the lives of thousands of people because
they remembered truths they had been taught by their
father. During the course of today’s lesson, ponder
what you think the Lord wants you to remember.

As explained in Helaman 5:1—4, Nephi resigned as
chief judge because the people had become very
wicked. He and his brother Lehi wanted to devote all
of their time to preaching the word of God. As they
began their ministry, they remembered the teachings
of their father, Helaman. Read the following verses
and summarize in the blanks provided what Helaman

asked his sons to remember. You may also want to
mark the word remember each time it appears in these
verses.

¢ Helaman 5:5-7

¢ Helaman 5:9-11

¢ Helaman 5:12

2. To help you better understand what you just read,
answer the following questions in your scripture study
journal:

a. How can remembering the righteous examples of others help
you choose to “do that which is good”? (Helaman 5:7).

b. What do you do to remember the Atonement of Jesus Christ?

Reread Helaman 5:12, looking for phrases that support
this principle: If we build our foundation on Jesus

Christ, Satan will have no power over us. (Helaman
5:12 is a scripture mastery verse. You may want to mark
it in a distinctive way so you can locate it in the future.)

Imagine that you were asked to design a building
that would never fall. Think about the answers to the
following questions:

¢ What kind of foundation would such a building
need to have?

e How does a strong foundation help a building
withstand weather, natural disasters, or other
difficult circumstances?

e What words or phrases in Helaman 5:12 suggest that
building upon the foundation of Jesus Christ, our
Redeemer, will not prevent attacks of the adversary
but will give you strength to overcome them?

221
3. Write answers to the following questions in your
scripture study journal:
a. What do you think it means to build the foundation of your
life on the rock of Jesus Christ? How are you striving to do this
in your life?
b. When have you been able to withstand temptation or trial
because the foundation of your life was Jesus Christ?
c. How can you improve in making the Savior the foundation
of your life?

Helaman 5:14-52

The Lord protects Nephi and Lehi in prison and disperses
darkness from their captors when they cry to Him and
repent

As recorded in Helaman 5:14-19, Nephi and Lehi
preached the gospel with great power in the land of
Zarahemla and baptized thousands of people there.
Then they traveled to the land of Nephi, which was
the land of the Lamanites. The following activity is
designed to help you understand the remarkable
experiences of Nephi and Lehi among the Lamanites.

4. Draw the following chart on an entire page in your

scripture study journal. Then read the verses in each box
and draw a simple picture or write a brief summary of what each
group of verses describes.

Nephi and Lehi among the Lamanites

Helaman 5:20-21 | Helaman5:22-25 | Helaman 5:26-28

Helaman 5:29-34 | Helaman5:35-39 | Helaman 5:40—44

In this experience the cloud of darkness can represent
sin and the pillar of fire encircling each person can
represent the Holy Ghost.

Review verses 28 and 34, and write how the people felt
when they were in the cloud of darkness:

Review verses 43 and 44, and write how the people felt
when they were encircled by the pillar of fire:

Review verses 41 and 42, and write what the people
did to remove the cloud of darkness, or in other words,
to repent of their sins:

Read Helaman 5:45—47, and ponder what truths you
learn about repentance from this experience. One

222

principle is: When we exercise faith in Jesus Christ
and repent of our sins, the Holy Ghost fills our
hearts with peace and joy.

In Helaman 5:48—52 we learn that about 300
Lamanites were part of this miracle and were
completely converted to the gospel. They went forth
and ministered to their people until “the more part of
the Lamanites” were also converted (Helaman 5:50).
These converts then laid “down their weapons of war”
(Helaman 5:51) and “did yield up unto the Nephites
the lands of their possession” (Helaman 5:52). In
most cases in the Book of Mormon, people regained
their lands through war, but in this case the Nephites
regained their lands because their enemies repented
and accepted the gospel.

5. Think about whether you are feeling peace and joy in

your life. Think about any clouds of darkness that may be
in your life, such as unrepented sin, contention with family
members or friends, or just failing to do things such as reading
the scriptures and praying regularly. Write one or more of these
in your scripture study journal. Ponder what you can do to follow
the example of the Lamanites in Helaman 5, and write what you
can do to invite the Savior to dispel clouds of darkness that may
be over you. How might repentance be part of the solution you
are looking for? How will repentance help you build on the
foundation of Jesus Christ?

CJ Scripture Mastery—Helaman 5:12

Read Helaman 5:12, and identify words that suggest
visual images to you (for example, rock, foundation,
wind, hail, storm). To help you memorize this verse,
take a piece of paper and write on it the first letter

of each word in the verse, unless a word suggests a
visual image. Then, in place of a letter, draw a simple
picture representing that word. Practice reciting the
verse using only your piece of paper. Place your paper
somewhere you will see it often to help you remember
the truths in this verse.

Helaman 6—9

Introduction

Following the missionary efforts of Nephi and Lehi,
the Lamanites increased in their righteousness.
Unfortunately, during this same time the Nephites
became wicked and supported the Gadianton robbers,
resulting in the Spirit of the Lord being withdrawn
from them. The prophet Nephi prophesied that if the
Nephites continued to live in wickedness, they would
perish. In response, corrupt judges stirred many of
the people up to anger against Nephi, while some
people boldly defended the prophet. As a testament
that his words would be fulfilled, Nephi revealed that
the chief judge had been murdered by his brother.
When Nephi’s words were verified, some of the people
accepted him as a prophet.

Helaman 6

The Lamanites become righteous and fight against the
Gadianton robbers, while the Nephites support the secret
combinations

1. Draw the following in your scripture study journal,
leaving room to write above and below the diagram:

fi

The influence of the Spirit in our live

U

As you have studied the book of Helaman, you have seen that the
Nephites made choices that led the Spirit of the Lord to withdraw
from their lives, while the Lamanites made choices that invited
the Spirit to increase in their lives. Read Helaman 6:1—5, 16-17,
34-36; look for what the Lamanites did that caused the Spirit of
the Lord to increase; and write them above the top arrow. In the
same verses, look for what the Nephites did that caused the Spirit
of the Lord to decrease, and write them below the bottom arrow.

An important principle we can learn from the Nephites
and Lamanites is: As we believe in and obey the
Lord’s words, He will pour out His Spirit upon us.
The opposite of this principle is also true: If we are

not willing to believe and obey the Lord’s words,
the Spirit of the Lord will withdraw from us.

Look at what you have written on the diagram in your
scripture study journal. Think about how those actions
on the top half are examples of being willing to believe
and obey the Lord’s words, while those on the bottom
are examples of being hardhearted and unwilling to
listen to the Lord.

2. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:
a. Choose one of the positive actions (on the top half of your
diagram) that you are doing or have done in your life. How has
this action invited the Holy Spirit into your life?

b. Look at the actions on the bottom half of your diagram. Why
do you want to avoid doing these things?

Choose one thing you can do to invite the Spirit of the
Lord to increase in your life, and strive to work on that
in the coming week.

Helaman 7

Nephi preaches to the wicked Nephites and commands
them to repent

The prophet Nephi served as a missionary in the land
northward for six years. He returned to his own home
after trying to teach the Nephites, who had rejected
his words and remained in their wicked state. He was
very discouraged. Read Helaman 7:6-11 to learn what
Nephi did.

After the people gathered to hear Nephi praying
upon the tower in his garden, Nephi began teaching
them (see Helaman 7:12-29). He warned them of the
consequences of their decisions and emphasized this
principle: If we refuse to repent of our sins, we
will lose the Lord’s protection and the blessings
of eternal life.

Helaman 8:1-26
Corrupt judges stir up the people to anger against Nephi

What are some influences that distract you from
listening to the words of the prophets? As you study
Helaman 8, look for insights into what you should do
when faced with such influences.

Read Helaman 8:1-6, looking for how the Nephite
judges (who were also Gadianton robbers) reacted to
Nephi’s teaching. As you read, ponder the following

223
questions: What was the judges’ main message to the
people? According to Helaman 8:4, why wouldn’t the
judges seize Nephi?

Think about what you would do if someone tried to
persuade you to disregard what prophets have taught.
In Helaman 8, some people spoke out against what
the judges were saying about Nephi. Read Helaman
8:7-9, and consider highlighting what the people said
to support Nephi.

Look at Helaman 8:10, and note the effect their words
had on the situation. You may want to write the following
principle next to Helaman 8:7-10: If we resist evil, we
can prevent it from progressing.

3. In your scripture study journal, write a short
paragraph explaining why you think the principle stated
above is important in our day.

4. Answer one or more of the following questions in
your scripture study journal:

a. How can you resist influences that try to persuade you to
ignore or resist the prophet’s teachings?

b. What might be appropriate ways to speak out against such
influences and support the Lord’s prophets?

c. When have you or someone you know stood up against such
influences? What were the results?

As recorded in Helaman 8:11-23, Nephi reminded the
people of prophet after prophet who had testified of
Jesus Christ. He taught the Nephites this principle: As
we exercise faith in Jesus Christ and are obedient,
we will receive eternal life. Despite the multitude of
prophets whose teachings confirmed Nephi’s words,
the people rejected Nephi and his message. Read
Helaman 8:24—26, and identify the consequences

the Nephites faced if they continued to reject the
testimonies of prophets. Then ponder the following
question: Why do you think those who consistently
deny the truth and rebel against God face such serious
consequences?

Helaman 8:27-9:41

Nephi reveals that the chief judge was murdered by his
brother

As proof that the people were in a sinful state and that
what he told them about their destruction would be

fulfilled, Nephi revealed that the Nephites’ chief judge
had been murdered. Nephi also declared that both the

224

murdered man and his brother were members of the
Gadianton robbers. (See Helaman 8:27-28.)

5. In your scripture study journal, write the following

principle: The words of the prophets will be fulfilled.
Imagine you are a detective investigating the murder of the chief
judge. Find the answers to the following questions by reading the
verses in parentheses. Write your answers in your scripture study
journal.

Day One of the Investigation:

a. When five people investigated Nephi's claims, what did they
find? Why did they fall to the ground? (Helaman 9:1-5)

b. Who did the people suspect were the murderers? (Helaman
9:7-8)

Day Two of the Investigation:

c. Who was proven innocent? (Helaman 9:10-14, 18)

d. Who was accused? (Helaman 9:16, 19)

e. What evidence of his innocence did Nephi give? (Helaman
9:25-36)

f. Who was the murderer? (Helaman 9:37—38)

Consider marking the answers to the following
questions in your scriptures:

e According to Helaman 9:5, what did the five men
who discovered the murdered chief judge believe
and fear?

¢ According to Helaman 9:36, what did Nephi say
that Seantum would testify of as he confessed to
murdering his brother?

e According to Helaman 9:39-41, why did some
people believe Nephi?

UNIT 23: DAY 1

Helaman 10

Introduction

After the trial concluded for the murder of the chief
judge (see Helaman 7-9), Nephi began to return

to his own house. He pondered what the Lord had
shown him and also worried about the wickedness
of the people. In Nephi’s moment of discouragement,
the Lord spoke to him and blessed him forever with
the sealing power. The Lord commanded Nephi

to continue preaching repentance to the people, a
command that Nephi immediately obeyed.

Creating a Learning
Environment

An ideal gospel learning set-
ting consists of order, rever-
ence, and a feeling of peace.
Try to remove interruptions
that may distract your study-
ing and pondering of the
scriptures. President Boyd K.
Packer, President of the
Quorum of the Twelve

“reverence invites revelation”

Helaman 10:1-11

Nephi receives the sealing
power

Think of a time when
you tried your best

to do what was right
but the reaction you
received from others or
the results you achieved
were different than you
expected. In Helaman 10
you will read about
how the Lord blessed
Nephi as he continued
to be faithful in difficult
circumstances.

After being cleared of the
murder of the chief judge,
Nephi found that the
people did not respond

in faith and repent after they witnessed the dramatic
events covered in Helaman 9. Nephi started to return
home feeling discouraged. Read Helaman 10:13, and
look for what Nephi pondered as he walked home.
You may want to mark each time the word pondering
is mentioned in these verses. Pondering means to
meditate and think deeply, often upon the scriptures
or other things of God. When combined with prayer,
pondering the things of God may bring revelation and

increased understanding.

Think about the following questions:

e What was Nephi pondering about?

e Why was he feeling “cast down,” or sad?

e What happened as he was pondering?

A principle shown in Helaman 10:1—3 is: Pondering
the things of the Lord prepares us to receive
revelation. Other examples in the scriptures also
illustrate this principle: Nephi pondered on things

his father, Lehi, had taught and learned of their
truthfulness (see 1 Nephi 10:17; 11:1); young Joseph
Smith “reflected... again and again” on James 1:5 and
had truth revealed to him (see Joseph Smith—History
1:11-19); and President Joseph F. Smith pondered and
reflected on scriptures dealing with the redemption

of the dead and had truth revealed to him (see D&C
138:1-6, 11).

Most revelation people receive when pondering the
things of the Lord, however, does not come through
hearing voices, seeing visions, or other such dramatic
ways. Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the
Twelve Apostles explained:

“Revelations are conveyed in a variety

of ways, including, for example, dreams,
visions, conversations with heavenly
messengers, and inspiration. Some
revelations are received immediately and
intensely; some are recognized gradually
and subtly... .

“...Most frequently, revelation comes in small
increments over time and is granted according

to our desire, worthiness, and preparation. Such
communications from Heavenly Father gradually
and gently ‘distil upon [our souls] as the dews from
heaven’ (D&C 121:45). This pattern of revelation
tends to be more common than rare and is evident in
the experiences of Nephi as he tried several different
approaches before successfully obtaining the plates
of brass from Laban (see 1 Nephi 3-4)....

“... The fundamental truths of the restored gospel
were not delivered to the Prophet Joseph Smith all at
once in the Sacred Grove. These priceless treasures
were revealed as circumstances warranted and as the
timing was right.

“President Joseph F. Smith explained how this
pattern of revelation occurred in his life: ‘As a boy
... would frequently . .. ask the Lord to show me
some marvelous thing, in order that I might receive
a testimony. But the Lord withheld marvels from me,
and showed me the truth, line upon line .. . , until
He made me to know the truth from the crown of
my head to the soles of my feet, and until doubt and
fear had been absolutely purged from me... .’ (in
Conference Report, Apr. 1900, 40-41).

225
“We as members of the Church tend to emphasize
marvelous and dramatic spiritual manifestations
so much that we may fail to appreciate and may
even overlook the customary pattern by which the
Holy Ghost accomplishes His work” (“The Spirit
of Revelation,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2011, 88).

1. Write in your scripture study journal about a time

you feel you received personal revelation. What were
the circumstances that brought about the revelation? How did
pondering help you receive revelation? (Remember that
revelation can come in many ways. It may involve sudden or
gradual moments of enlightenment and understanding or
feelings of peace and assurance.)

Set aside time to ponder regularly in your life, such

as during church meetings, before and after personal
prayers and scripture study, after watching or listening
to general conference, while fasting, or while honoring
the Sabbath.

Imagine you had something that was of great worth to
you and you needed to leave it in someone else’s care.
Who would you trust to take care of it? Why would you
choose that individual? What has that person done to
earn your trust?

Read Helaman 10:4—5, and look for why the Lord
trusted Nephi. Unwearyingness means “never tiring.”

226

Ponder the examples of people you know who seem
to serve the Lord with unwearyingness no matter
what the circumstances may be.

The Lord’s response to Nephi in Helaman 10:4 teaches
the principle: The Lord entrusts us with blessings
and responsibilities when we put His will before
our own.

2. Respond to one or more of the following questions
in your scripture study journal:

a. In what ways do you come to know what the Lord's will is
concerning your life?

b. What have you done in your life recently to show the Lord
that His will is more important than your own will and that it is
what you want to follow at all times?

c. What is one area of your life in which you could better seek
and follow the Lord's will instead of your own?

Read Helaman 10:5-7, and identify the blessings

and promises the Lord gave to Nephi for being
trustworthy. Write the blessings and promises next to
the corresponding verse:

Verse 5:

Verse 6:

Verse 7:

The blessing identified in Helaman 10:7 is a central
doctrine of the gospel of Jesus Christ: The sealing
power binds and looses on earth and in heaven.
Do you know of other people in the scriptures who
were given this sealing power? You may want to
cross-reference Helaman 10:7 with the following
scriptures: 1 Kings 17 (Elijah); Matthew 16:15-19
(Peter); Doctrine and Covenants 132:46 (Joseph
Smith).

Read Doctrine and Covenants 128:9, and identify
what the Prophet Joseph Smith taught about the
sealing power.

The same keys of the sealing power are held today
by the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints. Just as the Lord was able to trust
Nephi, the Lord also knows the President of the
Church will not use this power in any way contrary
to His will. This sealing authority is delegated to
other worthy priesthood holders around the world,
enabling priesthood ordinances to be binding on
earth and in heaven.
Think about the following statement by Elder Bruce R.
McConkie of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
regarding the importance of this sealing power:

“All things that are not sealed by this
power have an end when men are dead.
Unless a baptism has this enduring seal,
it will not admit a person to the celestial
kingdom; unless an eternal marriage
covenant is sealed by this authority, it will
not take the participating parties to an exaltation in the
highest heaven within the celestial world.

“All things gain an enduring force and validity because
of the sealing power” (Mormon Doctrine, 2nd ed.
[1966], 683).

3. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. According to Elder McConkie, what happens if an ordinance
is not sealed by the proper authority?

b. How has the sealing power impacted your life, and how
would you like it to bless your life in the future?

Read the following affirmation by Elder Russell M.
Nelson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles that
God’s sealing power has been restored: “Temples,

ordinances, covenants, endowments, and sealings have
been restored, precisely as prophesied. Ordinances of
the temple provide for reconciliation with the Lord and
seal families together forever. Obedience to the sacred
covenants made in temples qualifies us for eternal
life—the greatest gift of God to man” (“Prepare for

the Blessings of the Temple,” Ensign, Oct. 2010, 42).

According to Elder Nelson, what qualifies us to receive
the promised blessings of the sealing power?

Helaman 10:12-19

Nephi obeys the Lord's command to preach repentance
unto the people

Have you ever been asked to do something by a
parent, employer, or leader and delayed doing it or
failed to do what was asked? Consider what message
you send when you delay acting on what is asked of
you.

Read Helaman 10:11-12, and look for how Nephi
responded to the Lord’s command for him to preach
repentance to the people. What do we show the Lord
when we respond immediately and quickly to His
counsel and commandments?

227
4. Read Helaman 10:13-18. Then, in your scripture study

journal, write a few sentences about what you learn from
Nephi’s example of responding to the Lord's commandment.
Write one way you can apply this in your life.

Nephi’s faithfulness showed that the Lord could
trust him, and he was blessed with great power and
protection.

CL) Scripture Mastery Review

For a scripture mastery review, read 1 Nephi 3:7;

2 Nephi 2:27; 2 Nephi 31:19-20; and Mosiah 2:17.
Consider how these scripture mastery verses apply
to Nephi and his ministry in Helaman 10.

Seek for ways to put the Lord’s will before your own
and to quickly obey. As you faithfully serve the Lord
as Nephi did, He will trust and bless you.

Helaman 11-12

Introduction

Helaman 11-12 covers 14 years of Nephite history
and shows the people going through a cycle of
righteousness and wickedness. Because of their pride,
the people refused to repent of their wickedness.
Nephi sealed the heavens, causing a drought and
famine. The drought and famine humbled the people,
and they repented and turned to the Lord. Because
they did not choose to be humble, the people began
to easily forget the Lord their God until they were
brought to a realization of how much they needed His
help. In His mercy, God chastens His people to bring
them unto repentance and salvation.

Helaman 11

The Nephites pass through a cycle of righteousness and
wickedness

1. Draw the following cycle of righteousness and

wickedness in your scripture study journal. This cycle is
often referred to as the “pride cycle.” Notice that element

228

number 4 of the cycle is missing from the diagram. What do you
think it would take to raise a people from destruction and suffering
to righteousness and prosperity? As you study Helaman 11, watch

As you read in Helaman 10, the people would not
listen to the word of God delivered by the prophet
Nephi. Review Helaman 10:18, and identify where you
think the Nephites were on the pride cycle at that time
(the end of the 71st year of the reign of the judges).

The following scripture activity will help you see

this cycle of righteousness and wickedness among
the Book of Mormon people throughout 14 years of
their history. In the following chart, read the scripture
references from Helaman 11, write a brief description
of the Nephites’ condition, and write in the numbers
showing where you would place them on the pride
cycle. Two examples are provided for you. Watch for
words to help you fill in the missing fourth step on
the cycle you drew in your scripture study journal.

As shown in the scripture activity, element 4 in the
pride cycle is “humility and repentance.” Write this
in the chart in your scripture study journal.

2. The pride cycle is not only a reflection of a society.

It can also be seen in a family or in an individual's life.
Understanding how it works can help us avoid it. Write in your
scripture study journal what you think is necessary for you to
avoid entering into the “pride and wickedness” or the
“destruction and suffering” phases of the cycle.

You may want to write the following principle in your
scriptures in Helaman 11: Through humility and
repentance, we can avoid pride and destruction.
You may want to mark in Helaman 11:4 what Nephi
hoped the famine would do for his people.

Think about answers to the following questions:

e Does a society, family, or individual need to follow
the pride cycle?

e What do you think a society, family, or individual
needs to do to avoid getting caught in the pride
cycle?

Elder Richard G. Scott of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles said the following concerning Nephi’s

prayer: “The Lord heard His servant's supplication [in
Helaman 11:10-14] and caused the famine to cease,
but not until the following year. This event illustrates
that the Lord hears our pleas immediately but then
answers when, in His wisdom, we will benefit the most
from His response” (“Nephi, Son of Helaman,” in
Heroes from the Book of Mormon [1995,] 154.)

President Ezra Taft Benson taught about what we can
do to avoid getting caught up in the pride cycle:

“God will have a humble people. Either
y wecan choose to be humble or we can

_ be compelled to be humble. Alma said,
_ ‘Blessed are they who humble themselves
without being compelled to be humble.’
(Alma 32:16.)

“Let us choose to be humble.

“We can choose to humble ourselves by conquering
enmity [hatred] toward our brothers and sisters,
esteeming them as ourselves, and lifting them as high
or higher than we are. ...

“We can choose to humble ourselves by receiving
counsel and chastisement. .. .

“We can choose to humble ourselves by forgiving
those who have offended us. ...

“We can choose to humble ourselves by rendering
selfless service. . . .

“We can choose to humble ourselves by going on
missions and preaching the word that can humble
others. ...

“We can choose to humble ourselves by getting to
the temple more frequently.

229
“We can choose to humble ourselves by confessing
and forsaking our sins and being born of God... .

“We can choose to humble ourselves by loving God,
submitting our will to His, and putting Him first in our
lives. ...

“Let us choose to be humble. We can do it. I know we
can” (“Beware of Pride,” Ensign, May 1989, 6-7).

Helaman 12
Mormon explains why the Lord chastens people

Imagine you were the prophet Mormon and had
finished writing about the 14 years of Nephite history
found in Helaman 11. How would you complete the
following statement: “And thus we can behold

Read Helaman 12:1, and identify what Mormon
wanted us to see. Think about what Mormon may
have meant by “the unsteadiness of the hearts of the
children of men.”

Study Helaman 12:2-3, and identify other lessons
Mormon wanted us to learn. Pay close attention to
the phrases “we may see” (verse 2) and “thus we see”
(verse 3).

3. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:
a. Why do you think it is so easy for those who are prospering
to forget the Lord?
b. What examples of ease and prosperity in our day might lead
a person to forget God?
c. What situations are you aware of where a person or group
has forgotten the Lord in their prosperity?

Some of the lessons Mormon wanted his readers to learn
are: If we are not careful, our prosperity can lead us
to forget the Lord, and the Lord chastens His people
to stir them up in remembrance of Him.

Elder D. Todd Christofferson of the
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught
about why the Lord chastens us:

“Though it is difficult to endure, truly we
ought to rejoice that God considers us
worth the time and trouble to correct.

“Divine chastening has at least three purposes: (1) to
persuade us to repent, (2) to refine and sanctify us, and
(3) at times to redirect our course in life to what God
knows is a better path” (“As Many as I Love, I Rebuke
and Chasten,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2011, 98).

Which of those purposes do you feel reflect the Lord’s
intention in chastening the Nephites and Lamanites

230

in Helaman 11-12? For which purposes has He used
chastening in your life?

4. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. Read Helaman 12:4—6, and look for additional descriptions
of those who forget God. What are personal attitudes that
prevent individuals from remembering God?

b. Read Helaman 12:7-13. Why did Mormon say “the children
of men... are less than the dust of the earth”? What does the
dust do that people are sometimes unwilling to do?

President Joseph Fielding Smith taught:
“Now this prophet [Mormon] did not
mean to say that the Lord has greater
concern for and loves the dust of the
earth more than he does his children. . . .
The point he is making is that the dust of
the earth is obedient. It moveth hither and thither at
the command of the Lord. All things are in harmony
with his laws. Everything in the universe obeys the law
given unto it, so far as | know, except man. Everywhere
you look you find law and order, the elements obeying
the law given to them, true to their calling. But man
rebels, and in this thing man is less than the dust of
the earth because he rejects the counsels of the Lord”
(in Conference Report, Apr. 1929, 55).

Mormon understood that people who would have
God be their guide are greater than the dust of the
earth. His comparison was to draw attention to those
who are prideful and reject the Lord’s voice and

who have unsteady hearts. As recorded in Helaman
12:9-20, Mormon reminded us of the Lord’s great
power over physical elements—they all move at His
command. Take a moment to ponder your own degree
of obedience to the Lord’s commandments. How
does your willingness to obey His commandments
demonstrate humility? How does using our agency
to disobey His words demonstrate pride?
5. Write and finish the following phrases in your
scripture study journal:

a. And thus | saw in Helaman 11-12...
b. Therefore, | will...

As we remember the Lord, hearken to His voice, and
repent, we show our humility and our faith in Him. In
turn, He keeps His promise to bless and prosper us,
eventually granting us eternal life.

Helaman 13-14

Introduction

A few years before the Savior’s birth, the Lord sent a
Lamanite prophet named Samuel to preach repentance
to the Nephites at Zarahemla. The prophet Samuel
was a second witness of Jesus Christ, along with the
prophet Nephi. He forewarned the Nephites of their
destruction if they did not repent. Samuel confronted
them about their tendency to reject the prophets and
their disposition to seek happiness in doing iniquity.
He announced the signs that would mark the birth and
death of Jesus Christ. He also taught that all mankind,
through the redemption of Jesus Christ, will be
brought back into God’s presence for judgment.

Helaman 13

Samuel warns the Nephites of their destruction if they
do not repent

When you have done something wrong and needed
to be corrected by a parent or other leader, how did
you respond?

The account of a prophet calling a people to
repentance recorded in Helaman 13-16 is unique
because it is the first instance in the Book of Mormon
of a Lamanite prophet calling Nephites to repentance.

Read Helaman 13:1-8, 11 to understand why Samuel
preached to the Nephites and what the Lord directed
him to say. These verses illustrate the principle:
Prophets receive and speak the messages God
puts into their hearts. What message did God put
into Samuel's heart? According to Helaman 13:7, what
effect did Samuel hope his message would have on the
Nephites?

1. In your scripture study journal, write about a time
when you felt that a parent or Church leader was inspired
to give a particular message. How did that message affect you?

In the spaces provided, write answers to the questions
in the following charts as you study Helaman 13:17-23
and Helaman 13:24—30.

231
HELAMAN 13:17-23

Principle: When we do not remember the Lord, we are more susceptible to pride and iniquity.

Which verses do you feel teach the above principle?

Why do you think it is essential to “remember the Lord your God in the things with which he hath blessed you”? (verse 22).

HELAMAN 13:24-30

Principle: If we reject the words of the Lord's prophets, we will experience regret and sorrow.

Which verses do you feel teach the above principle?

What excuses did Samuel say the Nephites used for rejecting the Lord’s prophets?

Why do you think people often accept false prophets in the way Samuel described?

Answer the next two questions by studying the most recent general conference talks in the Ensign or Liahona:

What are some of the specific teachings of our living prophets and apostles

What are some specific problems prophets and apostles have arned us to avoid?

Review Helaman 13:26—28, looking for how the
Nephites had been responding to false prophets.

President Ezra Taft Benson declared: “How we respond
to the words of a living prophet when he tells us what

we need to know, but would rather not hear, is a test
of our faithfulness” (The Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson
[1988], 140).

2. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. What is an example of prophetic counsel you have chosen
to obey?

b. How have you been blessed for following this counsel?

c. How can you improve in following the counsel of living
prophets?

232

Samuel prophesied that the Nephites would be
destroyed in 400 years if they did not repent (see
Helaman 13:9-10), and he taught that the only
reason they had not been destroyed already was
because of the righteous people who lived among
them (see Helaman 13:12-14).

Read Helaman 13:38 to discover how so many
Nephites in Samuel’s day had become so wicked.

Samuel declared that we cannot obtain happiness
in doing iniquity, which helps us understand that
true happiness comes only as we keep the
commandments of God. Which scripture mastery
passage also teaches this truth? (See footnote c for
Helaman 13:38.)

President Ezra Taft Benson helped us
understand this principle when he said:
“There is an old saying that states: It is
better to prepare and prevent than it is
to repair and repent. How true that is.
...The first line of defense in keeping
ourselves morally clean is to prepare ourselves to resist
temptation and prevent ourselves from falling into sin”
(“The Law of Chastity,” in Brigham Young University
1987-88 Devotional and Fireside Speeches [1988], 51;
speeches.byu.edu).

Samuel taught that the Nephites’ decision to

delay repentance would result in their misery and
destruction. Other accounts in the Book of Mormon
teach that individuals can persist in rebellion and
wickedness until the spirit of repentance may leave
them. For example, Laman and Lemuel would

not hearken unto God and became “past feeling”
(1 Nephi 17:45). Such examples demonstrate why
it is so important for us not to procrastinate our
repentance. Through repentance you can make
things right and prevent sin and temptation from
overcoming your desire to follow God.

Read the following statement by President Dieter F.
Uchtdorf of the First Presidency to better understand
that you can regain a correct course in life if you take
a wrong course:

“During my training to become an airline
captain, I had to learn how to navigate an
airplane over long distances. Flights over
huge oceans, crossing extensive deserts,
and connecting continents need careful
planning to ensure a safe arrival at the
planned destination. Some of these nonstop flights
can last up to 14 hours and cover almost 9,000 miles.

“There is an important decision point during such long
flights commonly known as the point of safe return.
Up to this point the aircraft has enough fuel to turn
around and return safely to the airport of departure.
Having passed the point of safe return, the captain has
lost this option and has to continue on. That is why
this point is often referred to as the point of no return.

“. Satan wants us to think that when we have sinned
we have gone past a “point of no return’—that it is too
late to change our course... .

“.. .To make us lose hope, feel miserable like himself,
and believe that we are beyond forgiveness, Satan
might even misuse words from the scriptures that
emphasize the justice of God, in order to imply that
there is no mercy. ...

“Christ came to save us. If we have taken a wrong
course, the Atonement of Jesus Christ can give us the
assurance that sin is not a point of no return. A safe
return is possible if we will follow God’s plan for our
salvation” (“Point of Safe Return,” Ensign or Liahona,
May 2007, 99).

How might President Uchtdorf’s remarks give hope
to those who feel they have sinned so much they have
gone beyond the “point of no return”?

Helaman 14

Samuel prophesies of the signs of the Saviors birth
and death

Think about an event that recently occurred outside
your country and received worldwide attention. How
do people learn about events that occur in other parts
of the world, such as natural disasters and wars? Why
do people want to know about events that occur in
other parts of the world?

Samuel prophesied about the Savior’s birth and death,
events that would take place far away from Zarahemla.
Study Helaman 14:3—-6, and mark in your scriptures
the signs that would accompany the birth of Jesus
Christ. Study Helaman 14:20-27, and mark the signs
that would accompany His death.

3. In your scripture study journal, write about how you

think you would have responded if you were there and
had heard Samuel make these prophecies. Of all the signs given,
which one do you think would most impress upon you the need
to repent?

These signs are both instructive and symbolic. When
Jesus Christ came into the world, light increased. When
He died, darkness increased. The same happens in our
lives when we either allow Him to enter our hearts or
prevent Him from entering.

Read Helaman 14:11-13, and identify Samuel’s
intent or purpose in preaching to the Nephites.

You may want to number in your scriptures what
Samuel wanted the Nephites to know and to do.
(The phrase “through his merits” in verse 13 means
through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.) From these
verses we learn that belief in Jesus Christ leads to
repentance and remission of sins.

Read Helaman 14:28—29, and look for why the Lord
provides signs and wonders. One truth we learn is:
The Lord provides signs and wonders to help
people believe in Him. Ponder the signs (evidences)
that you feel help you to believe in Jesus Christ.

233
As you learn about the signs prophesied by Samuel,
it is important to remember that the Lord provides
signs to help the righteous people believe and repent,
while the wicked seek or demand signs for their own
selfish reasons (see D&C 46:9). While the signs of the
Lord’s death or the signs of His Second Coming are
important to know, Samuel's teachings regarding the
significance of the death and Resurrection of Jesus
Christ are essential to know.

Carefully read Helaman 14:15-19, and then study the
diagram below.

After reading Helaman 14:15-19 and studying the
diagram, consider the following points:

¢ Being born into mortality may be termed a spiritual
death because we are separated from the presence
of our Heavenly Father.

¢ Through His death and Resurrection, Jesus Christ
redeems all mankind from the Fall so we can
return to God’s presence.

e Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, all mankind

are brought back into the presence of God to be
judged.

1. The Fall of Adam and
Eve brought about the
first spiritual death (see
Helaman 14:16).

Death and the
Spirit World

234

2. Resurrection brings aff mankind
back into the presence of God
to be judged (see 2 Nephi 2:20;

Helaman 14:17).

e At the Final Judgment, people who continue to
refuse to repent will experience another spiritual
death—being cut off from God’s presence forever.

¢ Jesus Christ redeems us from a spiritual death
on conditions of repentance.

Mark phrases in Helaman 14:15-19 that correspond
to the bolded doctrines you just read. Conclude by
reading Helaman 14:30-31.

4. Inyour scripture study journal, write about how you
would use Helaman 14:30-31 to explain to a friend why
our choices in this life are so important.

5. Write the following note at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture study journal:

Helaman 15-16

Introduction

As Samuel the Lamanite addressed the Nephites
from on top of the wall at Zarahemla, he prophesied
that unless they repented, God would “utterly
destroy them” (Helaman 15:17). He declared that

the Lamanites had become more righteous than the
Nephites and that the Lord would prolong the days
of the Lamanites. Some Nephites believed Samuel’s
teachings and were baptized by Nephi. Others, who
did not believe Samuel, attempted to kill him. He was
protected by the power of God, and he returned to his
own land.

Helaman 15

Samuel warns the Nephites and explains why the
Lamanites became a people of promise

The following are hypothetical situations of two
young men:

One young man was raised by parents who were not
members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints and did not emphasize the teachings of Jesus
Christ. They allowed their teenage son to drink alcohol,
a practice that he continued in college. He later met
some Latter-day Saint missionaries. After meeting
with the missionaries a few times, he pledged to give
up alcohol. A few days later he was with a group of
friends. They offered him an alcoholic drink.

Another young man was raised in a Latter-day Saint
family. His parents held family home evening and
family scripture study regularly. He developed a

habit of daily scripture study and personal prayer.

He attended Primary, served in Aaronic Priesthood
quorums, and graduated from seminary. He knew
and understood the gospel of Jesus Christ and God’s
commandments. While attending college he developed
new friendships. One night some friends offered him
an alcoholic drink.

Consider the level of spiritual strength that might be
expected from each of these two young men in their
situations and how it compares with the Lamanites
and the Nephites you study about in Helaman 15.

1. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. According to Helaman 15:3, 17, what was the spiritual
condition of the Nephites?

b. According to Helaman 15:4—8, what was the spiritual
condition of the Lamanites? (The word circumspectly in Helaman
15:5 means “cautiously” or ”watchfully.”)

Although the Lamanites had a long history of
wickedness “because of the iniquity of the tradition

of their fathers,” as they came to a knowledge of the
truth, they repented and became “firm and steadfast in
the faith” (Helaman 15:4, 7). The Nephites, in contrast,
became full of pride and rejected the truths of the

gospel.

Carefully read Helaman 15:7-8, and fill in the

blanks in the following statement: Knowledge of

the truth and a belief in the holy scriptures leads to
and which bring

; therefore, as many as

come to this are

As the Lamanites learned the truth by studying and
believing the scriptures, they developed faith in Jesus
Christ and were led to repentance. They experienced
a change of heart and became firm and steadfast in
the faith.

2. Answer one or both of the following questions in your
scripture study journal:

a. When has your study of the scriptures helped you make
needed changes in your life?

b. How do you think a habit of faithful scripture study can help
a person receive a change of heart?

235
Samuel's teachings help us understand the importance
of staying true to the knowledge and faith that we
have obtained. Read Helaman 15:14-17, and look for
phrases that indicate the following gospel principle: If
people become unbelieving after having received
the fulness of the gospel, they will receive greater
condemnation. You may wish to write this truth in
your scriptures next to the verses. You may also want to
write D&C 82:3 as a cross-reference in the margin of
your scriptures.

What application does this principle have in your life?
Have there been times when you knowingly acted
against what you knew to be true? What do you need
to do to strengthen your faith in the Savior, repent, and
be firm and steadfast in gospel truths?

Helaman 16

Those who believe Samuel are baptized; others harden
their hearts

Reflect upon how you usually respond to the words
of the living prophets and apostles. The Nephites were
given the chance to receive the Lamanite prophet
Samuel’s words. Use what you learn from Helaman
16:1-7 to fill in the following chart to identify which
people believed and how the Nephites responded.

3. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. Why do you think some young people might get angry and
reject the counsel of the prophets today?

b. When have you seen someone choose to follow the counsel
of a prophet even though others rejected it?

c. When have you chosen to follow the counsel of a prophet
even though others around you rejected it?

d. What do you learn about the words of the prophets in
Helaman 16:13-14?

Ponder the following statement from
| President Ezra Taft Benson concerning
_ how people of the world respond to
_ modern-day prophets: “The prophet
will not necessarily be popular with
the world or the worldly. As a prophet
reveals the truth, it divides the people. The honest
in heart heed his words, but the unrighteous either
ignore the prophet or fight him. When the prophet
points out the sins of the world, the worldly, rather
than repent of their sins, either want to close the
mouth of the prophet or else act as if the prophet
didn’t exist. Popularity is never a test of truth. Many
a prophet has been killed or cast out. As we come
closer to the Lord’s second coming, you can expect
that as the people of the world become more wicked,
the prophet will be less popular with them” (The
Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson [1988], 133).

Read Helaman 16:16—21 to discover how nonbelievers
justified their rejection of the fulfillment of the
prophecies and signs from heaven. Perhaps you could
mark in your scriptures which of these excuses or
arguments against the prophets you believe is most
common in our day.

Read Helaman 16:23, and write in your scriptures or
your scripture study journal the consequence that
comes to those who reject the Lord’s witnesses. Your
statement could be similar to the following principle:
When we reject the Lord’s witnesses, we allow
Satan to get hold upon our hearts.

Read the following statement from President Henry B.
Eyring of the First Presidency, and mark any of his
words that confirm what you have learned from
Helaman 16: “When we reject the counsel which
comes from God, we do not choose to be independent
of outside influence. We choose another
influence. We reject the protection of a
perfectly loving, all-powerful, all-knowing
Father in Heaven, whose whole purpose,
as that of His Beloved Son, is to give us
eternal life, to give us all that He has,
and to bring us home again in families to the arms

of His love. In rejecting His counsel, we choose the
influence of another power, whose purpose is to make
us miserable and whose motive is hatred. We have
moral agency as a gift of God. Rather than the right

to choose to be free of influence, it is the inalienable
right to submit ourselves to whichever of those powers
we choose” (“Finding Safety in Counsel,” Ensign, May
1997, 25).

What did President Eyring say happens when we reject
God’s influence in our lives? Why is it important to
understand that when we reject God’s influence, we
come under Satan’s influence?

Consider if there is any way you have hardened your
heart against counsel the prophets and apostles have
given. It may be helpful to review the For the Strength
of Youth pamphlet as you think about what they teach
and how you accept their counsel. Decide what you
will do today to be firm and steadfast in living the
gospel and in heeding the counsel of the Lord’s
prophets.

INTRODUCTION TO
3 Nephi

Why Study This Book?

As you study 3 Nephi, you will learn about the
Savior’s words and actions during His ministry among
the people of the Book of Mormon. Church leaders
have referred to 3 Nephi as the “fifth Gospel” of
our Lord because, like the four Gospels of the New
Testament, it focuses on the direct teachings and
ministry of Jesus Christ (see Gordon B. Hinckley,
“The Cornerstones of Our Faith,” Ensign, Nov.

1984, 52). President Ezra Taft Benson taught that

“3 Nephi contains some of the most moving and
powerful passages in all scripture. It testifies of Jesus
Christ, His prophets, and the doctrines of salvation”
(“The Savior’s Visit to America,” Ensign, May 1987, 6).
In seeing how Jesus Christ demonstrated compassion
for the people “one by one” (3 Nephi 11:15; 17:21),
you can better understand His concern for you as

an individual. You can also learn important lessons
by noting how some people prepared themselves to
meet the Savior while others prevented themselves
from experiencing magnificent blessings.

Who Wrote This Book?

Mormon abridged records from the large plates

of Nephi to create the book of 3 Nephi. The book
is named for Nephi, the son of Nephi, whose labors
spanned the periods before, during, and after the
Savior’s appearances to the people. During the time
of great wickedness that preceded Jesus Christ's
visits, Nephi ministered “with power and with great
authority” (3 Nephi 7:17). Yet Nephi’s ministry was
only a prelude to the ministry of Jesus Christ, whose
words and deeds constitute the principal focus of

3 Nephi. While making his abridgment of Nephi’s
record, Mormon also added his own commentary
and testimony to this book (see 3 Nephi 5:8-26;
26:6-12; 29-30).

When and Where Was It Written?

The original records used as sources for the book of
3 Nephi were likely written between 1 B.c. and 34 B.c.
Mormon abridged those records sometime between
A.D. 345 and A.D. 385. Mormon did not record where
he was when he compiled this book.

238

3 Nephi 1

Introduction

Before departing out of the land, the prophet Nephi
(the son of Helaman) passed the records to his oldest
son, Nephi. The unbelievers plotted to put the faithful
to death if the prophecies concerning the birth of Jesus
Christ were not fulfilled by a certain day. As Nephi
pleaded with the Lord on behalf of the believers,

the voice of the Lord came to him and declared that
the sign of His birth would be given that night. In
fulfillment of the prophecy of Samuel the Lamanite,
when the sun set there was no darkness and a new
star appeared. Despite Satan’s continued attempts to
destroy the faith of the people, “the more part of the
people did believe, and were converted unto the Lord”
(3 Nephi 1:22).

3 Nephi 1:1-26
The prophecies concerning Jesus Christ's birth are fulfilled,
and many Nephites are converted

Think of some people in the scriptures or in Church
history who have sacrificed their lives for the gospel
of Jesus Christ. Why do you think they were willing
to make that sacrifice?

As recorded in 3 Nephi 1, a group of faithful Nephites
had to decide if they were willing to give up their lives
to remain true to their beliefs. The chapter begins by
explaining that Nephi gave the sacred records to his
son, who was also named Nephi, and then departed
out of the land (see 3 Nephi 1:1—3). It then relates the
test of faith that many Nephites experienced.

Read 3 Nephi 1:4—9, and look for the challenging
situation the faithful Nephites faced. How would you
feel if you were Nephi and the time had arrived when
the believers were about to be destroyed? Ponder for
a moment why some people might struggle to remain
faithful in this situation.

Read 3 Nephi 1:10-12, and look for what Nephi did
in this critical moment. Read the Lord’s response to
Nephi in 3 Nephi 1:13-14. You may want to mark the
statement in 3 Nephi 1:13 that indicates this principle:
The Lord will fulfill all the words that He has
caused to be spoken by His prophets.

As you read 3 Nephi 1:16-18, notice how the wicked
responded when the signs occurred. You may wish

to mark some of their reactions. We learn in 3 Nephi
1:18 that some of the people “began to fear because of
their iniquity and their unbelief.” Ponder the following
question: How does sin and unbelief lead to fear?

Read 3 Nephi 1:22—23, and look for what the devil

Bishop Richard C. Edgley, who served in the
Presiding Bishopric, offered counsel concerning how
we can respond during our own tests of faith. Mark
any of his words or phrases that encourage you to
choose to believe despite the doubts that Satan may
tempt you with:

“Because of the conflicts and challenges
we face in today’s world, I wish to
suggest a single choice—a choice of
peace and protection and a choice that
is appropriate for all. That choice is faith.
Be aware that faith is not a free gift given
without thought, desire, or effort... . The Savior said,
‘Come unto me’ (Matthew 11:28) and ‘Knock, and it
shall be [given] you’ (Matthew 7:7). These are action
verbs—come, knock. They are choices. So I say, choose
faith. Choose faith over doubt, choose faith over fear,
choose faith over the unknown and the unseen, and
choose faith over pessimism. .. .

“... When logic, reason, or personal intellect come
into conflict with sacred teachings and doctrine, or
conflicting messages assault your beliefs . . . choose

to not cast the seed [of faith] out of your heart by
unbelief. Remember, we receive not a witness until
after the trial of our faith (see Ether 12:6)” (“Faith—the
Choice Is Yours,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2010, 31-33).

2. What lies and deceptions does the devil promote
today to try to harden peoples’ hearts against the truth?

Write in your scripture study journal what you can do to maintain

your faith in Jesus Christ and His restored gospel even when the
devil tries to cause you to doubt your faith.

Read 3 Nephi 1:24—25, and identify an additional
challenge that some of the believers faced. Ponder
what you can learn from the response of these people
when they learned they were wrong.

240

3 Nephi 1:27-30
Nephite dissenters and some of the Lamanite youth join
the Gadianton robbers

A few years after the signs of Jesus Christ’s birth were
given, some dissenting Nephites began to have an
effect on the ability of the faithful to stand firm in the
gospel. How can you stand firm in the gospel, even
amid attacks against the Church in our day? Read

3 Nephi 1:27—-30, and look for whether the “rising
generation” of Lamanites had a positive or negative
impact on the faith of others.

Notice that many of the Lamanite youth “became for
themselves” (3 Nephi 1:29) and turned away from the
gospel. Sister Kathleen H. Hughes, who served in the
Relief Society general presidency, suggested a meaning
of the phrase “they became for themselves”: “[This]
implies to me that they looked to themselves first and
indulged desires that prophets had warned them to
avoid. They yielded to Satan’s enticements and allures”
(“Grow Up unto the Lord,” Ensign, Feb. 2010, 18).

You may wish to write the following principle in your
scriptures next to 3 Nephi 1:29-30 or in your scripture
study journal: If we give in to temptation, our
example can have a negative impact on the faith
and righteousness of others.

3. To help you understand how this principle relates
to you, answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. When have you witnessed an example of the principle
above? How can you remain faithful even if those around you
choose not to?

b. While it is important to know that our example can have a
negative impact on others, it is also important to remember that
our example can help strengthen someone else. When have you
seen the “rising generation,” or youth of the Church today, have
a positive impact on the faith of others?

4. In your scripture study journal, make a list of some

of the ways that you can have a positive influence on the
faith of people in your own family, your ward or branch, or your
peers. Choose two ideas from your list, and write specifically what
you will do to accomplish this.

Introduction

Soon after the people saw the signs of Jesus Christ’s
birth, they began to forget the witnesses they had
received, and they hardened their hearts. Many of the
Nephites and Lamanites rejected further signs and
wonders and increased in wickedness. As a result, the
Gadianton robbers grew in strength and threatened
to destroy the Nephites. The Nephites’ chief judge,
Lachoneus, gathered all the righteous Nephites and
Lamanites together and called on the people to repent
and prepare for battle. Because of their unity and
faith in the Lord, they triumphed over their enemies.
Following their deliverance, the righteous Nephites
and Lamanites acknowledged the power of God in
their preservation.

3 Nephi 2
The righteous Nephites and Lamanites unite to defend
themselves against the Gadianton robbers

Think about a few significant spiritual experiences
you have had in your life. (Remember that spiritual
experiences need not be dramatic or unusual to be
meaningful.) Why do you think it might be important
to remember these spiritual experiences?

Read 3 Nephi 2:1-3, looking for what happened
among the people when they began to forget the signs
related to the Savior’s birth. What can you learn from
this account about the danger of forgetting spiritual
experiences?

One of the principles we can learn from what happened
to the Nephites is that if we forget previous spiritual
experiences, we become more vulnerable to Satan’s
temptations and deceptions. You might want to write
this principle in your scriptures next to 3 Nephi 2:1-3. As
you do, think about why forgetting spiritual experiences
can make us more vulnerable to Satan.

Ponder what you can do to help you recognize and
remember spiritual experiences. List a few ideas you
think would be of most help:

President Henry B. Eyring of the First Presidency
related how recording his spiritual experiences in a
journal helped him. As you read about his experience,
underline some blessings that can come from
recording spiritual experiences:

“T wrote down a few lines every day for
years. I never missed a day no matter how
tired I was or how early | would have to
start the next day. Before I would write, I
would ponder this question: ‘Have I seen
the hand of God reaching out to touch

us or our children or our family today?’ As I kept at it,
something began to happen. As I would cast my mind
over the day, I would see evidence of what God had
done for one of us that I had not recognized in the busy
moments of the day. As that happened, and it happened
often, I realized that trying to remember had allowed
God to show me what He had done.

“More than gratitude began to grow in my heart.
Testimony grew. I became ever more certain that our
Heavenly Father hears and answers prayers. | felt more
gratitude for the softening and refining that come
because of the Atonement of the Savior Jesus Christ.
And I grew more confident that the Holy Ghost can
bring all things to our remembrance—even things we
did not notice or pay attention to when they happened”
(“O Remember, Remember,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov.
2007, 67).

1. In your scripture study journal describe how

remembering spiritual experiences has helped you stay
faithful despite Satan's attempts to tempt or deceive you. (This
may include remembering spiritual experiences by recording
them in a journal.)

As recorded in 3 Nephi 2:4-19, many of the Nephites
continued in wickedness and the Gadianton robbers
increased in numbers and in strength. They became
more violently aggressive, leading the converted
Lamanites to join forces with the Nephites to fight
against them. Although they had some success in
driving the Gadianton robbers out of their lands,

the Nephites and Lamanites were still in perilous
circumstances 15 years after the signs of Jesus Christ’s
birth were given.

3 Nephi 3:1-10
The leader of the Gadianton robbers demands that the
Nephites and Lamanites surrender

In 3 Nephi 3:1-10 we see an example of how the devil
sometimes works through others to try to weaken our
faith and lead us astray. Giddianhi, the leader of the
Gadianton robbers, wrote a letter to Lachoneus, chief
judge and governor of the combined Nephite and
Lamanite peoples, to persuade him to surrender to the
Gadianton robbers. Read 3 Nephi 3:2-10, looking for
words or phrases that illustrate the tactics Giddianhi
used to try to weaken Lachoneus’s faith and lead him

241
astray. You may want to mark these words or phrases
as you find them.

These verses teach that Satan and his followers
often use flattery, false promises, and threats to
lead people astray. It is important to realize that
Satan’s tactics are often more subtle, and he may use
our friends and people we like rather than obvious
enemies to tempt us. Still, there are similarities
between Giddianhi’s motives and tactics and the
way Satan works today to lead people astray.

2. Pick one of Giddianhi’s tactics, and explain in your
scripture study journal how the devil might use a similar
tactic on youth today. Also write how you can resist this tactic.

3 Nephi 3:11-4:33
Lachoneus's people prepare to defend themselves, and they
defeat the Gadianton robbers

Lachoneus was astonished by Giddianhi’s letter and
determined to prepare his people for the impending
attack. Read the following scripture passages, and
identify at least four ways Lachoneus prepared

his people spiritually and temporally (physically)

to withstand the attack of the Gadianton robbers.
(Hint: as you study these verses, be sure to differentiate
between Giddianhi, the leader of the Gadianton
robbers, and Gidgiddoni, the great prophet and chief
captain among the Nephites.)

3. Ona blank page in your scripture study journal,

draw a line down the center of the page. Write the
phrase Preparations of Lachoneus at the top of one side and
the phrase Modern Parallels at the top of the opposite side.

242

Under the heading “Preparations of Lachoneus,” write or draw
the four ways you identified that Lachoneus and the Nephites
prepared to withstand the attack. Under the heading “Modern
Parallels,” write or draw several examples of modern parallels
to what Lachoneus did to prepare the people. These parallels
should depict the spiritual and temporal preparations we have
been counseled to make in the latter days.

4. To help you think about how you can apply what you
learned, answer two or more of the following questions
in your scripture study journal:

a. How can you fortify your home against the attacks of the
adversary?

b. How does gathering together in families, branches, or wards
provide protection for us?

c. Why is daily scripture study a vital way to strengthen
yourself?

d. When has prayer helped you gain spiritual strength against
adversity or danger?

e. How can repentance be a form of preparation for the future?

f. Why do you think choosing to follow those who have the
spirit of prophecy and revelation is especially important today?

To see what happened when the Gadianton robbers
attacked Lachoneus and his people, read 3 Nephi
4:7-12. From this account we learn that as we
prepare ourselves spiritually and temporally, we
can overcome challenges through the strength of
the Lord.

Lachoneus and his people were able to defeat the
Gadianton robbers and destroy the robbers’ leaders.
They were victorious because of their choice of leaders
(see 3 Nephi 3:19; 4:17), their obedience (see 3 Nephi
3:21; 4:18), and their reliance upon God (see 3 Nephi
4:30-31). Read 3 Nephi 4:30-33, and look for how
the people responded after their victory over the
Gadianton robbers. What did the people acknowledge
as the causes for their deliverance from the Gadianton
robbers? One principle these verses illustrate is:
Recognizing the goodness and mercy of God in
our deliverance from difficulties helps us remain
humble.

3 Nephi 5
Peace is restored among the people; Mormon explains his
abridgment of the records

Think about how a personal spiritual experience has
influenced your faith, your desires, or the way you
acted after that spiritual experience. Read 3 Nephi
5:3—4, and look for what the Nephites did as a result
of the help and blessings they received from the Lord.
Notice that one of the ways the people responded was
to preach the gospel to others.
In 3 Nephi 5:14-26, Mormon explained why he was
making his abridged record. Read 3 Nephi 5:12-13, and
look for what Mormon said about his responsibility in
writing his abridgement of the Nephite records.

From these verses we learn that as disciples of Jesus
Christ, we have a responsibility to teach others the
way to everlasting life. One of the most important
ways we can show our gratitude to the Lord for what
He does for us is by helping others come to Him and
receive the blessings He has for them.

5. Write in your scripture study journal a few ways you

could teach others the way to everlasting life as a disciple
of Jesus Christ. Also think of some situations when you would be
able to teach this to others.

3 Nephi 6-10

Introduction

Following their miraculous deliverance from the
Gadianton robbers, the Nephites and Lamanites
enjoyed peace for three years. Pride, class distinctions,
and persecutions then arose and led to great wickedness
and the eventual overthrow of the Nephite government.
The signs of Jesus Christ’s death in Jerusalem included
great destructions that destroyed many Nephite cities,
killing the wicked inhabitants. Darkness covered the
land for three days. Amidst the darkness, the voice of
the Savior invited the people to return to Him. When
the darkness dispersed, the peoples’ mourning turned
to joy and praise of Jesus Christ.

3 Nephi 6-7
The Nephites become prideful, the Church is broken up,

secret combinations destroy the government, and the
people divide into tribes

Think about a time when you had to make a decision
about whether or not you would follow the prophet.
As recorded in 3 Nephi 6-7, some of the Nephites
experienced the tragic results of rejecting the prophets,
while others experienced the blessings that come

from repenting and hearkening to the Lord’s chosen
servants.

As you read in 3 Nephi 5, the Nephites repented and
diligently served God and were divinely delivered from
the Gadianton robbers. The Nephites then prospered
for a short time. However, pride quickly entered the
hearts of many, which caused divisions within the
Church. Prophets were sent forth to preach against the
wickedness of the people, but the judges took them
and put them to death secretly (see 3 Nephi 6:4—23).
Within approximately six years, the people yielded
“themselves unto the power of Satan” (3 Nephi 7:5)
and became so wicked that they fought against all
righteousness. Secret combinations destroyed the
government of the land and caused the people to be
divided into tribes.

Despite the wickedness of the people, Nephi
continued to testify against their sins and call them

to repentance (see 3 Nephi 7:15—-20). Read 3 Nephi
7:21-22, and mark a few examples of how the people
were blessed for following Nephi. From these verses
we learn that if we will repent and follow the Lord’s
servants, we will enjoy the influence of the Holy
Ghost in our lives.

243
1. Write in your scripture study journal about a time
when you chose to follow the counsel of the prophet or
other priesthood leaders. How were you blessed for doing so?

3 Nephi 8:1-18
Great destruction fulfills the sign of Jesus Christ's death

Imagine the day when the Second Coming of Jesus
Christ arrives. How do you think you might feel when
that time comes? In a similar way, the Nephites had
long been waiting for the coming of Jesus Christ.
Samuel the Lamanite had prophesied of the signs
that would occur at the death of Jesus Christ (see
Helaman 14:20-27). Read 3 Nephi 8:3—-4, and notice
the differences in how some of the Nephites felt about
the signs.

Read 3 Nephi 8:5-7, and look for what happened in
the 34th year from the date of the sign of the Savior’s
birth. Skim 3 Nephi 8:8-18, looking for what happened
to the inhabitants of the cities that were affected by
the storm and the accompanying earthquakes. Read

3 Nephi 10:11-12, and mark who was able to survive
this destruction. Even though the survivors were the
“more righteous part” of the Nephites, they still needed
to repent and come unto Jesus Christ.

2. Use a page in your scripture study journal to create a

newspaper article reporting the events in 3 Nephi 8:5-18.

Include a headline, sketch a picture, and then write a report of
the destruction.

3 Nephi 8:19-25

Darkness covers the land for three days

Think of a time when you were in a totally dark place,
such as a cave or a room without windows when
someone shut off the lights (or imagine what it would
be like). How did it feel to be in the dark and not be
able to see? Read 3 Nephi 8:19-23, and look for what
came after the storms and destructions ceased. (You
may want to mark any words or phrases that indicate
how severe the darkness was.)

Read 3 Nephi 8:24—25, looking for what the Nephites
said would have prevented the death and destruction
of so many of their people.

3. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. How are the effects of sin like being in darkness?
b. How is repentance like allowing light into a darkened room?

244

3 Nephi 9:1-14
In the darkness, the voice of Jesus Christ invites those who
survived the destruction to repent and come unto Him

During the three days of darkness, the voice of the
Savior spoke to those who had been spared. Read

3 Nephi 9:1-2, 7, and look for why the Savior said this
destruction occurred among the people. Then read

3 Nephi 9:13-14, and look for what the Savior said to
comfort the people in their suffering. You may wish to
mark the portions of these verses that are meaningful
to you.

Elder C. Scott Grow of the Seventy testified that the
Savior invites all of us to come unto Him and be
healed:

“Jesus Christ is the Great Healer of

our souls. With the exception of sins of
perdition, there is no sin or transgression,
pain or sorrow, which is outside the
healing power of His Atonement.

“When we sin, Satan tells us we are lost.
In contrast, our Redeemer offers redemption to all—no
matter what we have done wrong—even to you and
to me” (“The Miracle of the Atonement,” Ensign or
Liahona, May 2011, 109).

The Savior’s invitation in 3 Nephi 9:13 to come unto
Him and receive His healing power applies to each of
us. In order for the Savior to heal us, we must accept
His invitation and come unto Him, repent of our sins,
and be converted.

4. Inyour scripture study journal, write about an aspect
of your life that could benefit from the Savior's healing
power. What do you need to do to invite Him to heal you?

3 Nephi 9:15-22
The Savior's voice proclaims that through His sacrifice the
law of Moses is fulfilled

As part of the law of Moses, which the Nephites were
living until this point, the Lord had commanded His
people to offer animal sacrifices as a type and shadow
of the ultimate sacrifice that He would eventually offer
through His Atonement. Use the Savior’s words in

3 Nephi 9:17 to complete the following sentence: “By
me redemption cometh, and in me is the

The Savior declared that all of the ceremonies, laws,
rites, and symbols of the law of Moses, which had
been given to point the people to Him, were fulfilled
as He completed His atoning sacrifice. Read 3 Nephi
9:19, and identify what the Savior declared that the
Nephites were no longer to offer. Then search 3 Nephi
9:20, and mark what they were to offer as a sacrifice
instead.

What do you think it means to offer a sacrifice of “a
broken heart and contrite spirit”? A contrite spirit is
one that is humble, teachable, and repentant. To deepen
your understanding of what it means to have a broken
heart and contrite spirit, read the following statement
by Elder D. Todd Christofferson of the Quorum of the
Twelve Apostles, and mark the words that he used to
define “broken heart” and “contrite spirit”:

“Tn ancient times when people wanted to
worship the Lord and seek His blessings,
they often brought a gift... . As you seek
the blessings of conversion, you can
offer the Lord the gift of your broken,
e or repentant, heart and your contrite, or
obedient, spirit. In reality, it is the gift of yourself—
what you are and what you are becoming.

“Ts there something in you or in your life that is impure
or unworthy? When you get rid of it, that is a gift to the
Savior. Is there a good habit or quality that is lacking in
your life? When you adopt it and make it part of your
character, you are giving a gift to the Lord” (“When
Thou Art Converted,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2004, 12).

Read 3 Nephi 9:21-22, and look for what the Savior
taught we need to be like in order to come unto Him.

5. Think of some young children that you know. In your
scripture study journal describe characteristics little
children have that we need in order to come to the Savior.

Complete the following principle with appropriate
words or phrases that you see in 3 Nephi 9:13-14,
20-22: If we come unto Jesus Christ with a broken
heart and contrite spirit, He will

. (There are multiple correct answers.)

6. To help you apply this truth, answer the following
questions:

a. What attitudes might prevent us from offering our broken
hearts and contrite spirits to the Lord?

b. How have you seen the Lord bless you as you have come
unto Him with a repentant heart and obedient spirit?

c. How can you better offer a broken heart and a contrite spirit
to the Lord?

3 Nephi 10

The Lord promises to gather His people as a hen gathers
her chicks

After hearing the voice of the Savior, the people were
so astonished that there was silence in the land for
many hours. Then the voice spoke again to the people
(see 3 Nephi 10:1-3). Read 3 Nephi 10:4-6, and
identify what the Savior said He tried to do to protect
and nourish the people. Mark the promise the Savior
extended in verse 6 to those who repent and come
unto Him with full purpose of heart.

The Savior used the metaphor of a hen gathering

her chickens under her wings to protect them from
danger. Think about ways the Savior is like a hen who
seeks to protect her chickens from danger. In addition,
according to 3 Nephi 10:4—6, why wasn’t the entire
house of Israel gathered?

Read 3 Nephi 10:8-10, and look for what happened
after the people heard the Savior’s voice.

3 Nephi 11:1-17

Introduction

Sometime following the great destruction and three
days of darkness, about 2,500 men, women, and
children gathered around the temple in the land of
Bountiful (see 3 Nephi 17:25). They heard a voice,
which they at first did not understand. As they tried
to listen, they understood that it was the voice of
Heavenly Father introducing His Son, Jesus Christ.
The Savior of the world appeared. Jesus Christ invited
the people to one by one personally witness that He
had been slain for the sins of the world by feeling the
wound in his side and the prints of the nails in His
hands and feet.

3 Nephi 11:1-7
The people hear the voice of the Father announcing the
appearance of His Son

Go outside with a pencil and this study guide, and
listen for 60 seconds. Write down as many sounds as
you can in the space provided:

Now put a star next to each sound that you think
would be difficult to identify or that you would be
unlikely to notice without trying to listen. Then
return inside.

Shortly after the great destruction and darkness
signifying the death of Jesus Christ, the people gathered
at the temple in the land of Bountiful. While they were
discussing what had occurred, a marvelous experience
took place that they at first could not understand. Read
3 Nephi 11:1—3, and look for what the people had
difficulty understanding. You may wish to mark how
God's voice is described and the effect that voice had
on those who heard it.

Take a moment to think about how characteristics of
the voice the people heard are like the promptings we
receive from the Holy Ghost. What truth can you learn
from 3 Nephi 11:1-3 about how the Lord and the Holy
Ghost often speak to us? One doctrine we can see
illustrated in these verses is: The Holy Ghost often
speaks to us in a still, small voice that we feel in
our hearts.

246

President Boyd K. Packer, President of the Quorum of
the Twelve Apostles, explained how the voice of the
Lord, through the Holy Ghost, operates on our mind
and heart:

“Perhaps the single greatest thing I learned
from reading the Book of Mormon is that
the voice of the Spirit comes as a feeling
rather than a sound. You will learn, as I
have learned, to ‘listen’ for that voice that
is felt rather than heard. ...

“The gift of the Holy Ghost . . . will guide and protect
you and even correct your actions. It is a spiritual voice
that comes into the mind as a thought or a feeling
put into your heart” (“Counsel to Youth,” Ensign or
Liahona, Nov. 2011, 17-18).

1. Think about a time when you have felt the voice of

the Lord or impressions of the Spirit come into your mind
or heart. Write in your scripture study journal about your
experience and what it felt like.

The Nephites heard the voice twice and did not
understand it. Read 3 Nephi 11:4-7, and look for what
the Nephites did differently the third time in order

to understand the voice. What do you think it means

that the people opened “their ears to hear” the voice?
(3 Nephi 11:5).

President Boyd K. Packer gave the following counsel
about what we need to do to listen to and understand
the voice of the Lord through the Holy Ghost.
Underline words or phrases that help you know what
to do, or what to avoid, to better hear the Lord’s voice
through the Holy Ghost.

“The Spirit does not get our attention by shouting.
It never shakes us with a heavy hand.The Spirit
whispers. It caresses so gently, indeed, that if we are
preoccupied, we can’t feel it at all.

“Occasionally, the Spirit will press just firmly enough
or often enough for us to pay attention; but from
my experience, most of the time, if we do not heed
the gentle feeling, if we do not listen with those
feelings, the Spirit will withdraw and wait until we
come seeking and listening, in our manner and our
expression” (“How Does the Spirit Speak to Us?”
New Era, Feb. 2010, 3).
You may wish to write the following principle in your
scriptures next to 3 Nephi 11:5—6 and in your scripture
study journal: As we learn how to listen to the voice
of the Lord through the Holy Ghost, we will be
able to understand the communication He gives us.

2. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. What helps you to prepare your mind and heart to hear and
understand the voice of the Lord?

b. When have you understood communication from the Lord
that you might have missed had you not been striving to hear it?

c. When have you received a prompting from the Holy Ghost
more than once before you understood and followed it?

3 Nephi 11:8-17
Jesus Christ appears and invites the people to come one
by one to touch His wounds

Try to visualize the events of 3 Nephi 11:8-10 as you
read them.

3. As you consider what it would have been like to

witness the appearance of the resurrected Jesus Christ to
the Book of Mormon people, write in your scripture study journal
what thoughts and feelings you might have experienced if you

had been there.

Elder Jeffrey R. Holland
of the Quorum of the
Twelve Apostles spoke
about the importance of
the Savior’s appearance
to the Nephites:

“That appearance
and that declaration

Mormon. It was the

When studying the scriptures,
it is often helpful to try to
visualize what is taking place
or to imagine how it might
have felt to be there with
those experiencing certain
events. This study skill can

decree that had informed
and inspired every

Nephite prophet for the
previous six hundred
years, to say nothing of their Israelite and Jaredite
forefathers for thousands of years before that.

“Everyone had talked of him, sung of him, dreamed

of him, and prayed for his appearance—but here he
actually was. The day of days! The God who turns every
dark night into morning light had arrived” (Christ and
the New Covenant: The Messianic Message of the Book of
Mormon [1997], 250-51).

Remember that the remaining Nephites and
Lamanites had recently experienced terrible
destruction and three days of total darkness. Read

3 Nephi 11:10—-12, and look for what Jesus Christ
wanted the people to know about Him and about what
He had done during His mortal ministry. Which of
the Savior’s statements do you think would be most
comforting for you to hear if you had been there?
Ponder why that statement would have meant so much
to you. You may wish to mark the phrase that is most
meaningful to you in your scriptures.

Read 3 Nephi 11:13-15, and mark what Jesus Christ
invited the people to do to receive the personal
knowledge He wanted them to have concerning Him.
Think about the answers to the following questions:
According to 3 Nephi 11:14, what did the Savior want
the people to know from this experience? Considering

247
there were about 2,500 people present at that time (see
3 Nephi 17:25), how long might this have taken? What
does this teach you about the Savior?

4. Inyour scripture study journal, answer the following
questions:

a. Why do you think the Lord wanted the people to see and
touch Him “one by one”? (3 Nephi 11:15).

b. How would it affect you to touch the wounds the Savior
received while atoning for your sins?

Consider writing the following truth in your scriptures
near 3 Nephi 11:11-15 or in your scripture study
journal: Jesus Christ invites me to receive a
personal testimony that He is my Savior.

5. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. How strong do you feel your personal testimony of the Savior
is? How has it grown and become stronger over the recent past?

b. What experiences have led you to gain your own personal
testimony of the Savior, or what could you do to gain a stronger
witness?

c. How can you know that the Savior is aware of you
individually?

248

Read 3 Nephi 11:16-17, and look for what the people
did after they had this personal experience with the
Savior. It may be helpful to understand that “Hosanna
is an exclamation of praise to the Lord.

a”

Take a closer look at 3 Nephi 11:15, and identify what
the people did after they personally felt the Savior’s
wounds. Since you were not there to personally feel
the Savior’s wounds, as did the people written of in
3 Nephi, how can you know that Jesus is the Christ?
(See John 20:30-31; Moroni 10:3-7; D&C 46:13-14
for some possible answers.)

To liken 3 Nephi 11:15 to yourself, complete the
following statement: When I receive a personal
testimony of Jesus Christ, I have a responsibility
to

Think about ways a person with a testimony of Jesus
Christ can “bear record” of Him.

President Boyd K. Packer taught the following about
testimonies: “You cannot force spiritual things. A
testimony is not thrust upon you; it grows. And a
testimony is a testimony, and it should be respected,
whether it is small or large. We become taller in our
testimony like we grow in physical stature and hardly
know it is happening, because it comes by growth”
(“How Does the Spirit Speak to Us?” 3).

6. Conclude this lesson by writing your testimony of

Jesus Christ in your scripture study journal. You may want
to include what you have done to gain your testimony or what
you plan to do to strengthen it. If prompted by the Spirit, read it
to someone else or invite someone to read it.

3 Nephi 11:18-12:48

Introduction

After the people who were at the temple in the land of
Bountiful had individually felt the marks of the wounds
in Jesus Christ’s side, hands, and feet, the Savior gave
Nephi and others power to baptize. The Savior warned
the people to avoid contention and promised that
those who live the gospel will inherit the kingdom of
God. He also taught them how to receive the blessings
of His gospel and instructed them to influence others
for good. The Savior declared that He had fulfilled the
law of Moses, and He gave the people a higher law to
prepare them to become like Him and our Father in
Heaven.

3 Nephi 11:18-30
Jesus Christ gives Nephi and others the power to baptize
and denounces contention

Do you recall your thoughts and feelings as you
prepared for your baptism, or have you watched a friend
or family member prepare to be baptized? Many people
have questions like “Who can baptize me?” and “How
is the ordinance of baptism performed?” Consider how
you would answer those questions.

While studying 3 Nephi 11:1-17, you learned about
Jesus Christ’s appearance to “the people of Nephi,
round about the temple which was in the land
Bountiful” (3 Nephi 11:1). These people felt the marks

of His wounds and became personal witnesses of His
Resurrection and divinity. Immediately following this
experience, the Savior taught them about baptism,
including who can baptize and how baptisms should
be performed.

Read 3 Nephi 11:18-22, 24-25, and write an answer to
the question “Who can baptize me?”

As recorded in 3 Nephi 11, from what the Savior said
and did, we learn: Baptism must be performed

by a person who holds proper authority. Modern
revelation clarifies that baptism may only be performed
by a person who holds the office of priest in the
Aaronic Priesthood (see D&C 20:46) or who has the
Melchizedek Priesthood (see D&C 20:38-39; 107:10-
11). Additionally, he must act under the direction of

a priesthood leader who holds the priesthood keys
necessary to authorize the ordinance (such as a bishop,
branch president, mission president, or General
Authority).

Read 3 Nephi 11:23-27, and write an answer to
the question “How is the ordinance of baptism
performed?”

baptism must be done in the manner set forth by errons onsequences

As recorded in 3 Nephi 11:28-30, the Lord counseled

the people not to dispute or contend (argue) with each 3 Nephi 12:1-16

other about baptism or other points of doctrine. He
taught that contention is of the devil and should be

How is it possible to be perfect? Elder
Russell M. Nelson of the Quorum of

the Twelve Apostles said the following
about the commandment to be perfect:

The relationship of an action to a consequence is
sometimes called the law of the harvest. Modern
revelation describes it this way: “Whatsoever ye sow,
that shall ye also reap; therefore, if ye sow good ye
shall also reap good for your reward” (D&C 6:33).

250
Jesus Christ’s teachings in 3 Nephi 12-14 are
sometimes referred to as the “sermon at the temple”
because they resemble and often increase our
understanding of the Savior’s well-known Sermon
on the Mount (see Matthew 5-7). President Harold B.
Lee taught, “In his Sermon on the Mount the Master
has given us somewhat of a revelation of his own
character, which was perfect, or what might be said to
be ‘an autobiography, every syllable of which he had
written down in deeds,’ and in so doing has given us
a blueprint for our own lives” (Decisions for Successful
Living [1973], 56). As you study 3 Nephi 12-14, look
for ways the Savior wants you to strive for perfection.

As in the Sermon on the Mount, the Savior began

his sermon to the Nephites with several beatitudes—
declarations of the blessed and joyful condition of those
who are faithful (see 3 Nephi 12:1-12). As you read
them, look for which attributes the Savior urges us to
develop and what blessings He promises as a result of
our doing so. As you read, you may want to mark these
attributes and promised blessings. It might be helpful
to know that poor in spirit (8 Nephi 12:3) means to be
humble and dependent on the Lord, to mourn (3 Nephi
12:4) refers to feeling a sorrow for our sins that leads to
repentance, and to be meek (3 Nephi 12:5) can mean to
be humble and gentle, to be submissive to God’s will,
or to be patient in enduring injury without resentment.

4. |dentify one attribute you just read about that you are

striving or will strive to gain. Record in your scripture
study journal what blessings you are receiving or hope to receive
as you develop that attribute.

From the many truths in 3 Nephi 12:1-12, we learn
that if we live according to the teachings of Jesus
Christ, we will be blessed and prepared to enter the

kingdom of heaven. As we do so, we will also be an
example or light to the world (see 3 Nephi 12:14-16).

3 Nephi 12:17—48
Jesus Christ teaches the multitude the higher law that will
help them become like Him and Heavenly Father

Jesus Christ taught the Nephites how to come unto
Him by repenting and obeying His commandments
(see 3 Nephi 12:19—20). In the remainder of

3 Nephi 12, He referred to parts of the law of Moses
and then taught a higher law. He introduced parts of
the law of Moses with phrases such as “it hath been
said by them of old time” or “it is written.” Then He
introduced the new and higher law, which He wants
us to live today, with the phrase “I say unto you...”

5. Read the following scripture references, and write in
your scripture study journal what behaviors the Savior
said would lead to perfection:
a. 3 Nephi 12:21-22. It may be helpful to understand that the
word raca is a derogatory term expressing contempt, open
dislike, or hatred.
b. 3 Nephi 12:23-24. Use footnote 24a to help discover what
it means to be reconciled to someone.
c. 3 Nephi 12:25. It may be helpful to understand that to “agree
with thine adversary quickly” refers to resolving conflicts with
others quickly and not allowing them to fester and grow into
bigger problems. Elder David E. Sorensen, while serving as a
member of the Seventy, taught, “Nowhere does this principle
apply more than in our families” ("Forgiveness Will Change
Bitterness to Love,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2003, 11).
d. 3 Nephi 12:27—30. It may be helpful to understand that /ust
refers to an inappropriate, evil, and selfish desire.

e. 3 Nephi 12:38—42.
f. 3 Nephi 12:43-45.

251
One principle we can learn from these verses in

3 Nephi 12 is: As we come unto Christ and keep
His commandments, we can become more like
Him and our Father in Heaven, who are perfect.

While we will not reach perfection in

this life, President James E. Faust of the
First Presidency explained that we must
strive to make progress toward perfection
now in order to be able to attain it in the
next life: “Perfection is an eternal goal.
While we cannot be perfect in mortality, striving for

it is acommandment, which ultimately, through the
Atonement, we can keep” (“This Is Our Day,” Ensign,
May 1999, 19).

3 Nephi 13

Introduction

As recorded in 3 Nephi 13, the Savior continued His
sermon at the temple in the land of Bountiful. He
warned the people against hypocrisy and taught them
that their righteous works were pleasing to Heavenly

252

Father. He also instructed the multitude to lay up
treasures in heaven and then directed His twelve
disciples to seek the kingdom of God first before
worrying about their own temporal concerns.

3 Nephi 13:1-18
The Savior warns the Nephites against hypocrisy and

teaches them to do righteous works that are pleasing
to Heavenly Father

Complete the following self-assessment in your
mind by choosing which phrase best describes your
motivation for doing alms (giving to others), praying,
and fasting:

I do alms because:

a. lam supposed to.

b. Ilove the Lord and enjoy helping other people.
c. | want others to think well of me.

I pray because:

a. | don’t want to say “no” in front of other people
when | am called on to pray.

b. It is just part of my daily routine.
c. I want to communicate with my Heavenly Father.

I fast because:
a. Fasting helps me draw closer to the Lord.
b. Other people will think I’m bad if I don’t.

c. My parents don’t let me eat when I should be
fasting.

In 3 Nephi 13, Jesus Christ taught the Nephite
multitude about the importance of a person’s motives
for doing alms, praying, and fasting. The responses
listed in this self-assessment reflect different motives
we might have for doing these or other acts of religious
devotion.

1. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal: Does it matter why we do righteous works?
Why or why not?

2. Copy the following chart into your scripture study
journal, and complete it by reading each scripture
reference and answering the two questions. As you read, it may
be helpful to know that a hypocrite is someone who puts on a
false appearance of righteousness or who says one thing and

does another.

Do alms (3 Nephi
13:1-4)

Consider the following questions:
e How can our motives for doing righteous works
affect the way we do them?

e What are some righteous motives that might inspire
a person to do alms, pray, or fast in secret?

One righteous motive for doing these things is to
please Heavenly Father. Read 3 Nephi 13:4, 6, 18,
and look for what the Lord promises those who act
righteously in private.

An important principle the Savior taught in these
verses is: If we act righteously because we love
Heavenly Father, He will reward us openly.

3. In your scripture study journal, write about when you
have felt blessed for seeking to do something to please
Heavenly Father rather than to be seen of others.

Briefly review your self-assessment at the beginning
of the lesson and evaluate your motives for doing
alms, praying, and fasting. Consider how you might
apply the Savior’s teachings to improve your motives
for doing these or other acts of devotion to the Lord.

The Savior gave additional instruction to the Nephites
about prayer. Read 3 Nephi 13:7, and look for how
the Lord described repeated or elaborate phrases that
are expressed without sincerity in prayer. The word
vain means empty, without thought or feeling. Vain
repetition can also mean thoughtlessly repeating the
same words or praying without faith.

4. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. Why do you think it is important to avoid vain repetition
in our prayers to Heavenly Father?

b. What are some things you can do to avoid vain repetition
as you pray?

Read 3 Nephi 13:8, and look for a principle Jesus
Christ stated about Heavenly Father. You may wish to
mark this principle in your scriptures. One object of
our prayers is “to secure for ourselves and for others
blessings that God is already willing to grant if we will
ask for them in faith” (Bible Dictionary, “Prayer”).

Read 3 Nephi 13:9-15, and ponder what the Lord
would have you learn about your prayers. Think of
ways to improve your prayers by applying what you
learned from the Savior’s teachings.

3 Nephi 13:19-24
Jesus Christ teaches the multitude to lay up treasures
in heaven

Have you ever read or heard a story about lost or
buried treasure? Sometimes in these stories the
treasure hunters finally reach their goal only to
find that the treasure is missing or never existed.
Read 3 Nephi 13:19-20, and identify the two kinds
of treasure the Lord spoke about. Which of those
treasures did He say would always be there for us if
we seek it?

253
5. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. What is the difference between “treasures upon earth” and
“treasures in heaven”?

b. From what you learn in 3 Nephi 13:21-24, what are some of
the truths the Savior taught about seeking earthly treasures and
heavenly treasures? (It may help you better understand these
verses to know that the word mammon is a term for worldliness
or riches.)

c. How can seeking treasures on earth distract us from seeking
treasures in heaven?

The Savior did not teach that money or earthly
possessions are evil. But He did emphasize the
importance of placing our hearts on heavenly
treasures that will endure and not on earthly riches.

One principle we can learn from 3 Nephi 13:19-24 is:
In order to have God as our master, we must love
and serve Him above the things of the world.

What might be some examples of trying to serve
God and mammon at the same time? Why may it be
difficult to always love and serve God instead of the
things of the world? Why is putting God first worth
the effort?

6. Read the following examples. In your scripture study
journal, indicate which master you think the person is
serving: God or mammon (worldliness).

a. A young man declines a job that would require him to miss

his Sunday meetings and instead chooses a lower-paying job
that does not require him to work on Sundays.

b. A young woman frequently complains to her parents of her
need for new clothes. The clothes she desires cost more than her
family can afford.

c. A young man pays his tithing regularly with the money he
receives from his job. But he uses his remaining income to
purchase entertainment items, including some inappropriate
movies and songs, and has saved no money to pay for a mission
or education.

d. A young woman frequently uses some of her income to
purchase small gifts to show her love for others.

3 Nephi 13:25-34
The Savior directs the twelve disciples to seek the kingdom
of God before their own temporal concerns

As they went forth to minister among the people, Jesus
Christ instructed His twelve Nephite disciples not to

worry about their temporal needs for food and clothing

(see 3 Nephi 13:25-31). Read 3 Nephi 13:32-33, and
look for what the Savior told His disciples concerning
their temporal needs. What did He promise those who
put God and His kingdom first in their lives?

254

A principle we can learn from these verses might be:
If we seek God's kingdom first, He will help us
provide for our needs.

7. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:
a. How does a person “seek .. . first the kingdom of God”?
(3 Nephi 13:33).
b. In what ways has the Lord taken care of your needs when
you have put Him first in your life?

President Ezra Taft Benson testified of the blessings
that come from putting God first in our lives (you
might want to write this quotation on a paper and
keep it in your scriptures to review or share in the
future):

“When we put God first, all other things
fall into their proper place or drop out of
out lives. Our love of the Lord will govern
the claims for our affection, the demands
on our time, the interests we pursue, and
the order of our priorities. .. .

“We should give God, the Father of our spirits, an
exclusive preeminence in our lives” (“The Great
Commandment—Love the Lord,” Ensign, May 1988,
4-5).

Ponder how you or those you know have been blessed
for putting God first in your lives.

3 Nephi 14

Introduction

Jesus Christ’s sermon at the temple continues in

3 Nephi 14. He taught the people about judging others
and instructed them to seek blessings from Heavenly
Father through prayer. The Savior also warned against
false prophets and emphasized the importance of
doing the will of God.

3 Nephi 14:1-6
The Savior teaches about judging others

Read the words of the second verse of the hymn “Lord,
I Would Follow Thee” (Hymns, no. 220)—or sing it to
yourself if you feel comfortable doing so:

Who am I to judge another
When I walk imperfectly?

In the quiet heart is hidden
Sorrow that the eye can’t see.
Who am I to judge another?
Lord, I would follow thee.

As recorded in 3 Nephi 14, the Savior continued to
teach the Nephites at the temple. Read 3 Nephi 14:1-2,
and consider how this direction from the Savior relates
to the second verse of the hymn that you read. (It may
help you to understand that the phrase “with what
measure ye mete” refers to the standard by which a
person measures or judges someone.)

1. Write answers to the following questions in your
scripture study journal:

a. How does the Savior’s counsel in 3 Nephi 14:1-2 relate to
the second verse of the hymn “Lord, | Would Follow Thee”?
b. How would you express the important truth the Savior taught

in 3 Nephi 14:2 in your own words? (You may want to also write
this truth or principle in the margin of your scriptures.)

Elder Dallin H. Oaks of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles provided insight that helps us understand the
Savior’s command to “judge not” in 3 Nephi 14:1. As
you read it, underline the type of judgments he said we
should avoid and why.

“There are two kinds of judging: final
judgments, which we are forbidden to
make, and intermediate judgments,
which we are directed to make, but upon
righteous principles. . ..

“The final judgment . . . is that future occasion in
which all of us will stand before the judgment seat
of Christ to be judged according to our works... .I
believe that the scriptural command to ‘judge not’
refers most clearly to this final judgment. .. .

“... Why did the Savior command that we not judge
final judgments? I believe this commandment was
given because we presume to make final judgments
whenever we proclaim that any particular person is
going to hell (or to heaven) for a particular act or as of
a particular time. When we do this—and there is great
temptation to do so—we hurt ourselves and the person
we pretend to judge. ...

“... Arighteous judgment must, by definition,

be intermediate. It will refrain from declaring that

a person has been assured of exaltation or from
dismissing a person as being irrevocably bound for
hellfire. It will refrain from declaring that a person
has forfeited all opportunity for exaltation or even
all opportunity for a useful role in the work of the
Lord. The gospel is a gospel of hope, and none of us
is authorized to deny the power of the Atonement to
bring about a cleansing of individual sins, forgiveness,
and a reformation of life on appropriate conditions”
(“Judge Not’ and Judging,” Ensign, Aug. 1999, 7, 9).

Ponder how Elder Oaks’s statement helps you
understand the Savior’s command to “judge not.”

2. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal: How can the principle from 3 Nephi 14:2
that we will be judged according to how we judge change
the way we look at others’ mistakes or weaknesses? Read
3 Nephi 14:12. How might this verse relate to this principle?

Have you ever had something small in your eye, such
as an eyelash or speck of dust? The scriptures refer to a
speck in one’s eye as a mote. A long, thick piece of wood
is referred to as a beam. The Savior used these images to
help us understand problems that arise when we judge
others unrighteously or inappropriately find fault with
them. Read 3 Nephi 14:35, and think about what the
mote and beam represent.

3. In your scripture study journal, draw a picture of what
the Savior described in 3 Nephi 14:4. Then answer the
following questions:

a. What do you think the mote represents?
b. What do you think the beam represents?

c. Why do you think the beam rather than the mote is used
to represent the faults of those who judge unrighteously?

255
Notice that the Savior’s analogy focuses on objects that
are lodged in the eye and, therefore, affect a person’s
vision. Ponder the following questions about yourself:
How can my faults affect the way I see others? How
can I apply Jesus Christ’s counsel in 3 Nephi 14:5?

Do you think it is ever appropriate or necessary to
make judgments regarding other people’s behavior?
The Prophet Joseph Smith clarified that while we are
not to judge others unrighteously, we are directed to
use righteous judgment (see Joseph Smith Translation,
Matthew 7:1 [in Matthew 7:1, footnote a]).

The following explanation offers additional insight into
the question of judging others: “Sometimes people
feel that it is wrong to judge others in any way. While
it is true that you should not condemn others or judge
them unrighteously, you will need to make judgments
of ideas, situations, and people throughout your life.
The Lord has given many commandments that you
cannot keep without making judgments” (True to the
Faith: A Gospel Reference [2004], 90).

To help you understand the importance of making
righteous judgments, read 3 Nephi 14:6 and identify
some judgments Jesus Christ instructed us to make.
Before you read, it may be helpful to understand
that to “give ... that which is holy unto the dogs”
and to “cast... pearls before swine” mean to share
something that is sacred with those who will not
appreciate it or understand its sacredness.

How does 3 Nephi 14:6 help you understand the need
to make righteous judgments? Elder Dallin H. Oaks
explained some other situations where we should
make righteous judgments:

“We all make judgments in choosing our
friends, in choosing how we will spend
our time and our money, and, of course,
in choosing an eternal companion. ...

“,. Arighteous judgment will be guided
by the Spirit of the Lord, not by anger,
revenge, jealousy, or self-interest” (“Judge Not’ and
Judging,” 9).

4. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. Why is it important to make righteous judgments in areas
such as choosing friends, deciding how we spend our time and
money, or choosing an eternal companion? What might be some
other instances where it would be necessary or appropriate to
make judgments of others?

b. How can you judge more righteously? Ponder if there is
anyone you could be more kind to or need to refrain from
judging unrighteously.

256

3 Nephi 14:7-12
The Savior teaches about seeking blessings from Heavenly
Father

Think about times when Heavenly Father has
answered your prayers. Read 3 Nephi 14:7-11, and
look for what Jesus Christ taught about Heavenly
Father's willingness to answer our prayers.

One principle we can learn from 3 Nephi 14:7-11 is
that Heavenly Father will bless us if we ask and
seek Him in prayer. How can knowing that Heavenly
Father is eager to answer your prayers change the way

you pray?

5. Ask a trusted adult the following question: When

have you felt Heavenly Father's love for you through the
way He responded to your prayers? Summarize his or her answer
and what you learned from it in your scripture study journal.

3 Nephi 14:13-27
The Savior teaches the importance of doing the will of
Heavenly Father

As the Savior continued to teach the Nephites
gathered at the temple, He gave several analogies to
help us understand the importance of obeying His
teachings. Each analogy contains a good example
and a bad example.

6. In your scripture study journal, draw a simple
illustration of the good example and bad example found
in each of the following three scripture passages. Also write
down what you think the Savior wants us to learn by comparing
the good and bad examples. Be prepared to show your pictures
to your class and to explain what you learned from these
analogies.
a. 3 Nephi 14:13-14
b. 3 Nephi 14:15-20

c. 3 Nephi 14:24-27
Read 3 Nephi 14:21-23, and think about what you
might say to a person who told you that all you need

to do to be saved in the kingdom of God is to say that
you believe in Jesus Christ.

assignments in your scripture study journal:

3 Nephi 15-16

Introduction

As the Savior continued teaching the people at the
temple in the land of Bountiful, He declared that the
law of Moses was fulfilled in Him and that He was
the light and law that the people should look to. The
Savior then explained to the twelve Nephite disciples
that the people in the Americas were some of the
“other sheep” of whom He spoke to the people at
Jerusalem (see John 10:14-16). He also promised
that those who repent and return to Him will be
numbered among His covenant people.

3 Nephi 15:1-10
The Savior declares that He has fulfilled the law of Moses

Have you ever wondered why the Lord asks us to
obey certain laws and commandments, such as paying
tithing, observing the Sabbath day, or honoring our
parents? As Jesus Christ continued to instruct the
Nephites, He taught them the central purpose behind
His laws and commandments. Watch for this purpose
as you study 3 Nephi 15.

As the Savior finished speaking to the multitude, He
perceived that some among them had a question.
Read 3 Nephi 15:1-2, and write what the people were
marveling and wondering about:

To understand why the Nephites were marveling and
wondering at the Savior’s declaration that the “old
things” of the law of Moses had passed away and

“all things had become new,” it helps to understand
that for centuries the Nephites had known and lived
under the law of Moses. Their laws, rites, and church
organization were based on the Mosaic law, which
law was given anciently by the premortal Jesus Christ
to prepare people for His coming and point them to
His atoning sacrifice. Now the Divine Lawgiver was
standing before them declaring that the Atonement
had been accomplished (see 3 Nephi 11:10-14) and
that in Him the law of Moses was fulfilled (see 3 Nephi
9:16-20; 12:46—47). His declaration that the old things
of the law of Moses had “passed away” and new
things were to take the law’s place suddenly changed
how they were to worship God.

The Savior responded to their concerns by
emphasizing a very important doctrine. Read 3 Nephi
15:3-5, 9, and highlight phrases in the Savior’s

response that might have reassured the Nephites that
the source of the law was not changing.

1. Answer the following question in your scripture study
journal: What do you think Jesus was teaching the
Nephites when He said, “I am the law”? (3 Nephi 15:9).

From the Savior’s teachings in these verses, we can
learn that Jesus Christ is the object of all the laws
and commandments of the gospel. Ponder why this
truth would have been important to the Nephites as
they learned that the old law of Moses was replaced
with the higher law and experienced changes in their
manner of worship.

Read 3 Nephi 15:9-10, and mark what the Lord wants
us to do as a result of this doctrine. Use what you learn
in these verses to complete the following principle:

If we to Jesus Christ through
keeping , He will give us

2. Think about commandments such as paying tithing,
observing the Sabbath day, and honoring our parents, and
answer the following questions in your scripture study journal:

a. How might a person follow the commandments and still not
be looking to Christ?

257
b. In what ways might our obedience to the commandments
change if our focus was on looking to Jesus Christ and not only
on obeying the rules?

One way our obedience to the commandments might
change if we looked to Christ is that our motivation to
obey would change from duty, or even love of the rule,
to love for the Lord.

Read the following statement by Elder
Marvin J. Ashton of the Quorum of

the Twelve Apostles: “What a spiritual
_ comfort and blessing it is to know that,
if we look to our Savior Jesus Christ
and endure to the end, eternal life

and exaltation can be ours... . God becomes more
approachable as we look to him. Looking to God
teaches us to serve and live without compulsion
[without being forced or pressured to do something]”
(“There Are Many Gifts,” Ensign, Nov. 1987, 21).

3. Choose a commandment that you may have wondered

why you need to obey, and consider how keeping that
commandment can lead you to Jesus Christ. You may want to set
a goal to be more obedient to the commandment you chose and
write a few ideas about how to accomplish it. Record your
thoughts in your scripture study journal.

3 Nephi 15:11-16:5
Jesus Christ speaks to His disciples concerning His other
sheep

Have you ever felt forgotten or alone and wondered if
Heavenly Father knew who you were? Although we
may feel alone or sometimes feel less important than
others, God cares for His people and manifests
Himself to them. Watch for evidence of this truth as
you study the rest of 3 Nephi 15 and the beginning of
3 Nephi 16.

As recorded in the New Testament and the Book of
Mormon, Jesus Christ ministered among the people
in the Old World and in the Americas. Read 3 Nephi
15:11-17 looking for what the Lord said He told those
in Jerusalem about His people in the Americas.

“Other sheep” is a reference to other followers of

the Shepherd, Jesus Christ. A fold is a sheep pen,

but the word fold is used in this instance to mean a
group of people with a common belief in Jesus Christ.
According to 3 Nephi 15:17, how did the Lord say He
would manifest Himself to His other sheep?

Jesus explained why Heavenly Father commanded
Him not to give more knowledge of His other sheep
to those in Jerusalem. Search 3 Nephi 15:18—20, and
mark the Savior’s explanation. By seeing that the

258

Father withheld greater knowledge of the Nephites
from the Jews because of the Jews’ iniquity, we can
learn an important principle concerning how we
receive knowledge and truth from the Lord. Based on
these verses, how would you complete the following
principle? God gives us knowledge and truth
according to our

The Lord told the Nephites that they were part of the
other sheep about whom He spoke in Jerusalem. The
Jews had thought He was speaking of the Gentiles
(non-Israelites). They did not understand that the
Gentiles would not “hear” the Savior’s voice (see

3 Nephi 15:21-23).

Read 3 Nephi 15:24, and look for how the Lord
specifically assured the Nephites of His care for them.

Read 3 Nephi 16:1-3, and find out who else would
hear the Savior’s voice. We do not have a scriptural
record of whom else the Savior visited, but it is clear

that He visited other groups and brought them into
His “fold.”

How does Jesus Christ show that He cares for those
people who do not get to hear His voice? Read

3 Nephi 15:22-23 and 3 Nephi 16:4, and look for how
the Lord said He will manifest himself to the Gentiles.

From what you have studied so far in 3 Nephi 15
and 16, what evidence have you seen that God cares
for His people and manifests Himself to them?

Read 3 Nephi 16:5, and look for what will happen in
the last days after the Gentiles come to a knowledge
of Jesus Christ and His gospel.

Jesus promised to bless all of His children—the

house of Israel and the Gentiles—by giving them His
words as written by the Nephites. The writings of the
Nephites would help convert the Gentiles, who would
then help to gather the house of Israel in the last days
(see 3 Nephi 16:45).

4. Inyour scripture study journal, answer the following
question: What evidence from your own life have you
found that shows Jesus Christ cares for all of us?

3 Nephi 16:6-20
Jesus Christ pronounces blessings on and gives warnings
to the Gentiles who live in the latter days

Have you ever wanted to be a part of a group, club, or
team? Think of a specific example. What is required
to become a member of such a group? The greatest
group you can become a member of is The Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the covenant people
of the Lord.

Read 3 Nephi 16:6-7, and look for what will happen
because of the Gentiles’ belief and the house of
Israel’s unbelief in the last days. It might be helpful to
understand that there will also be unbelieving Gentiles
in the last days who will scatter and mistreat members
of the house of Israel (see 3 Nephi 16:8—9). The Lord
will take away His gospel from the wicked and reveal
it to the righteous, both Israelites and Gentiles, in the
last days (see 3 Nephi 16:10-12).

Read 3 Nephi 16:13, and look for what is required

to become one of the Lord’s covenant people. Using
what you have learned in 3 Nephi 16:13, complete the
following principle: If we ,
then we will be numbered among His people.

5. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:
a. How do you know you are part of the Lord’s covenant
people?
b. How has it blessed your life to be numbered among His
people?

assignments in your scripture study journal:

with my teacher:

3 Nephi 17

Introduction

As His first day with the Nephites drew to a close,
Jesus Christ perceived that many people did not fully
comprehend what He had taught them. Therefore, He
taught them how to receive additional understanding.
The people wept when He said He was leaving. Filled
with compassion, the Savior remained with them
longer. He healed their sick, blessed their children, and
prayed for them. The multitude felt great joy and love
for the Savior as they interacted with Him.

3 Nephi 17:1-3
Jesus commands the people to ponder His words and pray
for understanding

How do you respond when you come across a teaching
in the scriptures or from a Church leader that you do
not understand? Circle all that apply:

e | just ignore the teaching.

e | ask another person to help me understand.
e I carefully think about the teaching.

e | ask Heavenly Father to help me understand.

The events recorded in 3 Nephi 17 occurred near

the end of Jesus Christ's first day with the Nephite
multitude. Read 3 Nephi 17:1-3, and mark what

the Savior told the Nephites to do in order to better
understand what He had taught them. Consider how
going to your home to ponder and pray can help you
better understand gospel truths.

President Henry B. Eyring of the First
Presidency explained what it means to
ponder. Read the following statement
and highlight words or phrases that
describe what it means to ponder:
“Reading, studying, and pondering
are not the same. We read words and we may get
ideas. We study and we may discover patterns and
connections in scripture. But when we ponder, we
invite revelation by the Spirit. Pondering, to me, is
the thinking and the praying I| do after reading and
studying in the scriptures carefully” (“Serve with the
Spirit,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2010, 60).

Look carefully at 3 Nephi 17:3, and notice that the
Savior instructed the people to “prepare [their] minds”
for their next experience with Him. Before moving

on in your study, ponder how you would answer the

259
following questions: What could you do to prepare
your mind before attending church? Before attending
seminary? Before listening to general conference?
Before studying the scriptures? What difference do you
think preparing your mind would make in what you
gain from those learning opportunities?

One of the principles we learn from these verses is:
By pondering and praying to the Father, we can
receive greater understanding. (You may want to
write this in your scriptures next to 3 Nephi 17:1-3.)

1. To help you apply this principle, select one or both of

the items below and incorporate the action into your life
during the coming week. Write in your scripture study journal
what you did. Also write about how this action increased what
you learned in church, seminary, or general conference or from
the scriptures. Be prepared to share this journal activity with your
teacher. Also, make a plan to continue to improve in one of these
areas during the coming weeks.

a. | will prepare my mind before | attend church or seminary.

b. | will ponder and pray about what | hear in church or
seminary.

3 Nephi 17:4-25
The Savior heals the sick among the Nephites and blesses
their children

Think about a time when you felt so uplifted and full
of joy that you did not want the experience to end.
Read 3 Nephi 17:4—5 to find out how the Nephites
reacted when the Savior said that He would return
to His Father.

The Savior responded to the Nephites’ righteous
desires with great compassion. The following activity
can help you understand more fully the love Jesus
Christ has for all of us. It can also help you discover
scriptural truths about the character and nature of
Jesus Christ.

2. Write the following scripture references in your
scripture study journal. Leave space under each reference
for further information: 3 Nephi 17:6-10; 3 Nephi 17:11-18;
3 Nephi 17:19-25. Study each of these scripture passages,
looking for truths about the Savior’s character—what He is like.
Find at least three truths, one truth for each scripture reference,
and record them under the appropriate reference.

One of the most tender and touching events described
in the Book of Mormon is Jesus blessing the little
children who were present on that occasion. This

260
episode helps us understand the nature and character
of Jesus Christ. Before he quoted the account of the
Savior and the children from 3 Nephi 17:11-12, 21-25,
President Boyd K. Packer stated, “In the account of
the Savior’s ministry among the Nephites, we can see
deeper into His soul perhaps than at any other place”
(“Teach the Children,” Ensign, Feb. 2000, 16-17).

Notice that the multitude brought those who were
sick and afflicted to the Savior, including those who
were “afflicted in any manner” (3 Nephi 17:9). These
afflictions could have been physical, emotional, or
mental. Ponder ways in which you may be “afflicted.”
How might the Savior help you with your afflictions if
He were to personally bless you?

3. Review the principle about pondering that you

learned at the beginning of this lesson. One way to
ponder is to visualize yourself in the same situation described in
the scripture account. Take a moment and visualize what it would
have been like if you had been a participant in the events
recorded in 3 Nephi 17. In your scripture study journal, describe
what you think you would have heard, seen, and felt on that
occasion and what you would have learned from the Savior. You
may also want to describe the blessing you might have sought
from the Savior.

Think of a sentence that
describes a truth you
learned from 3 Nephi
17:6-25. Write the

Visualizing

You can ponder the scriptures
by using the principle of visu-
alizing. To do this, try to see in

your mind the events of the
scriptures or imagine yourself
as a participant in the story
you are reading. Visualizing
can help you think about,
understand, and apply what
you read in the scriptures.

these verses or in your
scripture study journal.
One of the truths from
these scriptures is: The
Savior feels great
compassion for us. Why
is it important for you to

know the truths about

the Savior’s character
that you have learned from these verses?

Read the following statement about faith: “In order for
your faith to lead you to salvation, it must be centered
in the Lord Jesus Christ... .You can exercise faith in
Christ when you have an assurance that He exists, a
correct idea of His character, and a knowledge that you
are striving to live according to His will” (True to the
Faith: A Gospel Reference [2004], 54).

4. Answer the following question in your scripture study
journal: How does understanding the Savior's
compassionate nature help you exercise faith in Him?

5. Share with another person something you learned

about the Savior from 3 Nephi 17. In your scripture study
journal, record the name of this person and a summary of what
you said to him or her.

Although we have not had the experience the
Nephites had with Jesus Christ, the day will come for
each of us when we will see and hear Him. Throughout
the next day or two, ponder this lesson. Think about
the Savior’s compassion as you pray about your
desires, weaknesses, heartaches, and trials.

3 Nephi 18

Introduction

As Jesus Christ concluded the first day of His ministry
among the Nephites, He administered the sacrament
and commanded the people to pray always to the
Father and to extend fellowship to all people. The
Savior promised great blessings to those who keep
these commandments. He then gave His twelve
Nephite disciples instructions concerning their
ministry in the Church. Before ascending into heaven,
He gave them power to give the gift of the Holy Ghost.

3 Nephi 18:1-14
Jesus Christ administers the sacrament to the Nephites

Read the following story by Elder Gerald N. Lund, who
served as a member of the Seventy, and imagine what
it may have been like to be the man in this story:

“Some time ago there was an interesting article about
mountain climbing [containing] a story that offers a
wonderful answer to the question, ‘What can we as
unprofitable servants ever do to repay Christ for what
He has done for us?’

“The article was about a man named Czenkusch who
runs a climbing school. . .. Czenkusch was describing
to the interviewer the belay system in mountain
climbing. This is the system by which climbers protect
themselves from falls. One climber gets in a safe
position and secures the rope for the other climber,

261
usually around his or her own body. “You’re on

belay,’ means, ‘I’ve got you. If something happens, I
will stop you from falling.’ It is an important part of
mountain climbing. Now note what followed next in
the article: ‘Belaying has brought Czenkusch his best
and worst moments in climbing. Czenkusch once fell
from a high precipice, yanking out three mechanical
supports and pulling his belayer off a ledge. He was
stopped, upside down, 10 feet from the ground when
his spread-eagled belayer arrested the fall with the
strength of his outstretched arms. “Don saved my life,”
says Czenkusch. “How do you respond to a guy like
that? Give him a used climbing rope for a Christmas
present? No, you remember him. You always remember
him’”’ [Eric G. Anderson, “The Vertical Wilderness,”
Private Practice, Nov. 1979, 21; emphasis added]” (“The
Grace and Mercy of Jesus Christ,” in Jesus Christ: Son
of God, Savior, ed. Paul H. Peterson, Gary L. Hatch, and
Laura D. Card [2002], 48).

Read 3 Nephi 18:1-11, and look for what Jesus Christ
asked the Nephites to do to remember Him. You may
want to mark the words remembrance and remember
in verses 7 and 11.Why do you think it is important
to always remember the Savior’s atoning sacrifice for
you? How do you act differently when you remember
the Savior?

The Savior’s command to remember His body and
blood would have been particularly meaningful to the
people because they had just felt the wounds in His
body only a short time before. Though you have not
seen the wounds in the Savior’s body, as the Book of
Mormon people did, you can remember His atoning
sacrifice as you partake of the sacrament.

1. In your scripture study journal, answer the following
question: How has remembering the Savior’s sacrifice
during the sacrament helped you feel gratitude for Him?

Jesus Christ’s words recorded in 3 Nephi 18:7-11
teach the following principles: As we partake of the
sacrament, we witness unto the Father that we

are willing to do all He has commanded. As we
partake of the sacrament, we witness unto the
Father that we will always remember Jesus Christ.
Review 3 Nephi 18:7-11, and mark words or phrases
that teach these principles. As you read verse 11, think
about how you would feel if the Savior said those
words to you.

2. Select two of the following questions to answer in
your scripture study journal:

a. What are some aspects of the Savior’s life and ministry you
might remember during the ordinance of the sacrament?

262

b. What can you do to always remember the Savior during
the rest of the week?

c. If you sincerely strive to remember the Savior during the

sacrament, how might this affect you during the week that
follows?

Identify another principle taught in 3 Nephi 18:7, 11
by completing the following statement with a phrase
that explains what the Savior promised to those who
partake of the sacrament and remember Him. As we
partake of the sacrament and always remember the
Savior, we will

3. Compare 3 Nephi 18:12-14 and Helaman 5:12. In

your scripture study journal, write how partaking of the
sacrament weekly can help you make Jesus Christ the foundation
upon which you build your life.

4. To help you remember the Savior more, record in your

scripture study journal each day for the next week what
you did to remember the Savior that day. You might include what
you thought about during the sacrament or how remembering
the Savior influenced your thoughts, words, and deeds.

3 Nephi 18:15-25
Jesus taught the Nephites to pray always to the Father
and to meet together often

After Jesus Christ administered the sacrament to the
Nephites, He taught them important principles about
prayer. One of the principles He taught is: If we will
be watchful and pray always unto the Father, we
can resist the temptations of Satan. When we are
watchful, we are spiritually alert, vigilant, or on guard.

Read 3 Nephi 18:15-21, and mark words or phrases
that teach the principle shown above. Why do you
think that both watching and praying are essential to
resisting temptation?
Notice that 3 Nephi 18:15, 20-21 is a scripture mastery
reference. Consider marking these verses in your
scriptures.

5. Read and think about the following questions, and
then answer two or more of the questions in your
scripture study journal:
a. How has praying helped you resist the temptations of Satan?
b. What can you do to improve your personal prayers?

c. What blessings have you experienced from praying with your
family? (see 3 Nephi 18:21).

d. What can you do to help your family have consistent and
meaningful family prayer?

As we pray to Heavenly Father and draw closer to

our Savior, Jesus Christ, we often want to help others
draw nearer to Him as well. Think about someone you
would like to help become closer to the Savior. Read

3 Nephi 18:22—24, and look for the following principle
in the verses: As we minister to others, we can help
them come unto Christ.

As recorded in 3 Nephi 18:24, the Savior taught that
we are each to hold up our light so it shines to the
world. He also said that He is the light we are to hold
up. Elder Robert D. Hales of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles taught that we hold up the light of the Savior
by keeping His commandments and following His
example:

“We should be like the Savior as He
admonished us to ‘Come, follow me.’
Wouldn’t it be pleasing to Jesus if we
could let our light so shine that those
who followed us would be following the
Savior? There are those searching for the
light [who] will gladly pass through the gate of baptism
onto the straight and narrow way that leads to eternal
life (see 2 Nephi 31). Will you be that light that will lead
them to a safe harbor? ...

“Have you ever stopped to think that perhaps you are
the light sent by Heavenly Father to lead another safely
home or to be a beacon from a distance to show the
way back to the straight and narrow path that leads

to eternal life? Your light is a beacon and should never
stop burning or mislead those who are looking fora
way home... .

“".. Jesus Christ is the light that has been given to
us so that we may follow and know where to go. [I
pray] that each one of us may choose the right [so that
we can] lift and strengthen those around us” (“That
Ye May Be Children of Light” [Church Educational
System fireside for young adults, Nov. 3, 1996], 6-7).

Praying for others, inviting them to attend Church
meetings, and setting a Christlike example are ways we
can minister to others. Reflect on how you felt when
you followed the example of Jesus Christ and helped
someone else come closer to the Savior. What will you
do today or this week to let your light shine so that
those who follow you will also be following the Savior?

3 Nephi 18:26-39

The Savior teaches His disciples to extend fellowship to

all people

After the Savior instituted the sacrament and taught
the Nephites about prayer, He turned to the twelve
disciples He had chosen and instructed them how to
lead and direct the affairs of the Church (see 3 Nephi
18:26—39). Notice in 3 Nephi 18:26 that the Savior
stopped speaking to the multitude and turned to

the leaders “whom he had chosen.” His message in
verses 28-29 was given to those priesthood leaders as
a warning against allowing those who were unworthy
to partake of the sacrament.

Church members should focus on their own
worthiness to partake of the sacrament and leave the
responsibility of determining others’ worthiness to
partake of the sacrament to those the Lord has called
to make such judgments, such as the bishop or stake
president. Read 3 Nephi 18:32, looking for how the
Savior taught the disciples to care for those who had
strayed from the faith. Think about how you could
“continue to minister” to a friend, family member, or

person in your ward or branch who has strayed from
the faith.

CL] Scripture Mastery—3 Nephi 18:15, 20-21

Consider spending a few minutes memorizing 3 Nephi
18:15, 20-21. Write the three verses on a piece of paper,
and then practice saying them. After reading them a
few times, start erasing or crossing out different parts
of the verses while you continue to say the verses. You
may want to repeat this process until all of the words
have been erased or crossed off.

As you are memorizing these verses, think about what
the Savior was teaching. As recorded in 3 Nephi 18:15,
Jesus Christ taught the Nephites how to withstand the
temptations of the devil. Note the power that comes
from prayer. Through prayer we can be given strength
to resist temptation.

As recorded in 3 Nephi 18:20-21, Jesus Christ taught
that when we pray in faith, the Father always answers
our prayers, but He answers according to His plan

for His children and what He knows is right for us.

263
Repeat verse 20 aloud: “And whatsoever ye shall ask
the Father in my name, which is right, believing that ye
shall receive, behold it shall be given unto you.” What
do you think the phrase “which is right” means in this
passage? (You may want to refer to James 4:3.)

President Gordon B. Hinckley shared
this testimony: “God, our Eternal Father,
lives. He is the Creator and Ruler of the
universe and yet He is our Father. He is
the Almighty and is above all. He can

be reached in prayer. . .. Does He hear
a child’s prayer? Of course He does. Does He answer
it? Of course He does. Not always as we might wish,
but He answers. He hears and answers” (Teachings of
Gordon B. Hinckley [1997], 468).

Elder Dallin H. Oaks of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles taught: “[In 3 Nephi 18:20] the Savior
reminds us that faith, no matter how strong it is,
cannot produce a result contrary to the will of him
whose power it is. The exercise of faith in the Lord
Jesus Christ is always subject to the order of heaven,
to the goodness and will and wisdom and timing of
the Lord. That is why we cannot have true faith in the
Lord without also having complete trust in the Lord’s
will and in the Lord’s timing” (“Faith in the Lord Jesus
Christ,” Ensign, May 1994, 100).

3 Nephi 19

Introduction

The events recorded in 3 Nephi 11-18 all took place
during one day. At the conclusion of that day, news
of the Savior’s visit and of His returning the next
day spread among the people, and they “did labor
exceedingly all that night, that they might be on the
morrow in the place where Jesus should show himself
unto the multitude” (3 Nephi 19:3). In the morning,
the twelve disciples taught the people and prayed
with them. Nephi then baptized the twelve disciples,
and they received the Holy Ghost and were encircled
by angels. During this manifestation, Jesus Christ

264

appeared and commanded the disciples to pray,
and He also prayed to the Father on behalf of the
multitude. Because of their faith, the disciples were
filled with the Holy Ghost. They were purified, and
they became one with the Father and the Son.

3 Nephi 19:1-14
The twelve disciples minister to the people as the Savior
commanded

Imagine how you might feel and what you might do if
you knew that tomorrow Jesus Christ would be coming
to a temple some distance from you. How hard would
you try to get there? Would you want to bring other
people with you? What would you do to prepare for
this experience?

Read 3 Nephi 19:1-3, looking for the Nephites’
response to the Savior’s promise that He would return
the next day. After the multitude gathered, the twelve
disciples divided the multitude into twelve groups and
began to teach them. They instructed the multitude

to kneel in prayer and taught them the same truths
the Savior had taught the previous day. (See 3 Nephi
19:4-7,)

1. Read 3 Nephi 19:8-9, and answer the following
questions in your scripture study journal:

a. What did the disciples most desire? From your experience,
why is the gift of the Holy Ghost so desirable?

b. The twelve disciples were going to direct the affairs of the
Church in the Americas after the Savior left. Why was it essential
that they have the Holy Ghost to guide them?

After you have completed your scripture study journal
assignment, ponder these questions: What are a few
things that you most desire when you pray? How often
do you pray for the Holy Ghost?

Read 3 Nephi 19:10—-12, and look for what the disciples
did after they had prayed. The baptism described in
verses 10-12 was the second baptism for the twelve
disciples. The Church had been established for many
years among the Nephites, and these priesthood
brethren would have previously been baptized,

even though their first baptism is not recorded in

the scriptures. This second baptism was a special
circumstance, as explained by President Joseph
Fielding Smith: “The Savior commanded Nephi and
the people to be baptized again, because he had
organized anew the Church under the gospel. Before
that it had been organized under the law [of Moses]”
(Doctrines of Salvation, ed. Bruce R. McConkie, 3 vols.
[1954-56], 2:336).
Keep in mind that the disciples and the other Nephites
were worthy to be in the presence of the Savior. Read
3 Nephi 19:13, looking for what the twelve disciples
were granted for having righteous desires.

2. Make a list in your scripture study journal of the

blessings that come into the life of a person who has the
gift of the Holy Ghost and lives worthy of it. Then compare your
list with the following quotation by Elder Robert D. Hales of the
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and add to your list any new
ideas you find:

The Holy Ghost gives us the strength and
courage to conduct our lives in the ways of the
kingdom of God and is the source of our testimony
of the Father and the Son... .

“We need the Holy Ghost as our constant
companion to help us make better choices in the
decisions that confront us daily. Our young men and women are
bombarded with ugly things of the world. Companionship with
the Spirit will give them the strength to resist evil and, when
necessary, repent and return to the strait and narrow path. None
of us are immune from the temptations of the adversary. We

all need the fortification available through the Holy Ghost. .. .
Having the gift of the Holy Ghost helps family members make
wise choices—choices that will help them return with their
families to their Father in Heaven and His Son, Jesus Christ, to
live with Them eternally” (”The Covenant of Baptism: To Be in
the Kingdom and of the Kingdom,” Ensign, Nov. 2000, 8).

Based on your study of 3 Nephi 19:1-14, ponder what
blessing you want most in your life and why you want it.

Complete the following principle statement based
on 3 Nephi 19:9, 13: Through earnest desires and
prayer, we can be

3 Nephi 19:14-36
The Savior appears and prays for the people to be purified
through their faith

Read 3 Nephi 19:14—16 to learn what happened after
the twelve disciples were baptized and filled with the
Holy Ghost.

After the disciples and the multitude had kneeled
down, the Savior commanded His twelve disciples

to pray. Read the account of their prayer in 3 Nephi
19:17-18, 24-26, 30. This is the only place in recorded
scripture where people prayed directly to Jesus Christ.
In our prayers we pray to God the Father in the name
of His Son, Jesus Christ. There is no place in scripture
where we are taught to pray to Jesus.

Elder Bruce R. McConkie of the Quorum of the
Twelve Apostles suggested a reason why the disciples
may have prayed to Jesus in this unique instance:
“Jesus had already taught them to pray in his name
to the Father, which they first did [see 3 Nephi 19:8—
9].... But this time ‘they did pray unto Jesus, calling
him their Lord and their God.’ [3 Nephi 19:18.] Jesus
was present before them as the symbol of the Father.
Seeing him, it was as though they saw the Father;
praying to him, it was as though they prayed to the
Father. It was a special and unique situation” (The
Promised Messiah: The First Coming of Christ [1978],
560-61). The Savior Himself said, “They pray unto
me because I am with them” (3 Nephi 19:22).

3. While the people were kneeling, they witnessed Jesus

Christ offer three distinct prayers for His disciples and for
them. Copy the following chart in your scripture study journal.
Read the assigned scripture references and complete the chart.

Elder Bruce R. McConkie taught, “Perfect prayers are
those which are inspired, in which the Spirit reveals
the words which should be used” (Mormon Doctrine,
2nd ed. [1966], 586).

To help you better understand some of the principles
the Savior taught in His prayers, review 3 Nephi 19:28
and mark words or phrases that teach this principle:
As we exercise faith in Jesus Christ, we can be
purified. Contemplate the ways in which the disciples
exercised faith throughout the experiences recorded in
3 Nephi 19. As a result of their faith, the disciples were
filled with the Holy Ghost (see 3 Nephi 19:13), and
receiving the Holy Ghost is necessary in order to be
purified.

Read the following statement from

= be purified: “’Then cometh the baptism

of fire and of the Holy Ghost.’ [2 Nephi

31:13.] This baptism of fire and of the Holy

Ghost here spoken of by Nephi affects the great change

in the hearts of men referred to by Alma [see Alma

5:14]. It converts them from carnality to spirituality.

It cleanses, heals, and purifies the soul... . Faith in

the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance, and water baptism

are all preliminary and prerequisite to it, but it is the

consummation [ultimate end]. To receive it is to have

one’s garments washed in the atoning blood of Jesus

Christ” (Learning for the Eternities, comp. George J.

Romney [1977], 133).

the following question in your scripture study journal:
How does exercising faith in Jesus Christ help us become pure

Jesus offered a great prayer on the eve of His atoning
sacrifice that was very similar to the prayers He offered
among the Nephites on the second day of His visit
with them. Read 3 Nephi 19:23, 29 and John 17:9, 11,
21-22. Mark the phrase “that we may be one.” Ponder
how Jesus Christ and the Father are one. What do we
learn from these verses about how we can become one
with Jesus Christ?

One of the principles taught in these
verses is: Through faith we can be
purified and become one with Jesus
Christ, as He is one with the Father.
Read the following statement from Elder
D. Todd Christofferson of the Quorum

of the Twelve Apostles about how we can be one with
the Father and the Son: “Surely we will not be one
with God and Christ until we make Their will and
interest our greatest desire. Such submissiveness is not
reached in a day, but through the Holy Spirit, the Lord
will tutor us if we are willing until, in process of time,
it may accurately be said that He is in us as the Father
is in Him. At times I tremble to consider what may be
required, but I know that it is only in this perfect union
that a fulness of joy can be found” (“That They May Be
One In Us,” Ensign, Nov. 2002, 73).

with my teacher:

3 Nephi 20-22

Introduction

During the second day of His ministry among

the Nephites, Jesus Christ again administered the
sacrament to the people. He testified that in the
latter days the Father would fulfill His covenant to
gather Israel and bless all the nations of the earth.
He also explained that the coming forth of the Book
of Mormon in the last days would be a sign that the
Father had begun to fulfill this covenant.
3 Nephi 20:1-9
The Savior again administers the sacrament to the people

If you are a young man and hold the Aaronic
Priesthood, ponder the following questions: What
does it mean to you to be able to help administer the
sacrament? How do you demonstrate to the Lord that
you understand the sacred nature of this ordinance?

If you are a young woman or a young man who does
not yet hold the priesthood, ponder the following
questions: How do you feel when you see worthy
young men administering the sacrament? What do
you do during the administration of the sacrament
that shows you understand its sacred nature?

As recorded in 3 Nephi 20:3—5, at the beginning of the
second day of His ministry among the Nephites, the
Savior miraculously provided bread and wine to again
administer the sacrament. Read 3 Nephi 20:1, and
identify what He asked the people to do just before He
prepared and passed the sacrament. How do you think
praying in your heart can affect your weekly experience
of partaking of the sacrament?

Read 3 Nephi 20:8. Notice that the Nephites used wine
at this time, but it is the current practice of the Church
to use water (see D&C 27:2). Also notice what the
bread and water represent. When we regularly partake
of the sacrament, we show our willingness to make the
Savior’s Atonement part of our lives.

According to 3 Nephi 20:8, what did Jesus Christ
promise to those who partake of the sacrament?
Think about the portion size of the bread and water
in the sacrament. If you were physically hungry and
thirsty, would the sacramental bread and water satisfy
your hunger and thirst? To better understand how
we can be filled by partaking of the sacrament, read

3 Nephi 20:9 and finish this principle: If we worthily
partake of the sacrament, we can be filled with

Read the following statement from Elder Dallin H.
Oaks of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and
underline ways he said you can be blessed as you are
filled with the Spirit:

“Let us qualify ourselves for our Savior’s
promise that by partaking of the
sacrament we will ‘be filled’ (8 Ne. 20:8;
see also 3 Ne. 18:9), which means that

we will be ‘filled with the Spirit’ (3 Ne.
20:9). That Spirit—the Holy Ghost—is our
comforter, our direction finder, our communicator, our
interpreter, our witness, and our purifier—our infallible
guide and sanctifier for our mortal journey toward
eternal life.

“Out of the seemingly small act of consciously and
reverently renewing our baptismal covenants comes
a renewal of the blessings of baptism by water and
by the Spirit, that we may always have his Spirit to

be with us. In this way all of us will be guided, and in
this way all of us can be cleansed” (“Always Have His
Spirit,” Ensign, Nov. 1996, 61).

1. Think of a time when you felt the Holy Ghost as you

partook of the sacrament. Read the sacrament prayers in
Moroni 4:3 and 5:2. How does partaking of the sacrament each
week help you to be filled with the Holy Ghost? Write some of
these ways in your scripture study journal.

3 Nephi 20:10-46
The Savior teaches the Nephites about covenants to be
fulfilled in the last days

Think about some of your most important qualities.
What type of qualities did you focus on? Were they
physical characteristics, personality traits, or spiritual
qualities?

Read the following statement by Elder David A.
Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and
mark how he defined who we are: “You may enjoy
music, athletics, or be mechanically inclined, and
someday you may work in a trade or a profession
or in the arts. As important as such activities and
occupations can be, they do not define who we
are. First and foremost, we are spiritual beings. We
are sons [and daughters] of God and the seed of
Abraham” (“Becoming a Missionary,” Ensign or
Liahona, Nov. 2005, 47).

To be the seed of Abraham means that we are literal
descendants of Abraham or we have become his sons
and daughters through obedience to the laws and
ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ. All receive
the same promises and covenants God made with
Abraham.

As recorded in 3 Nephi 20:11-13, the Savior taught
the Nephites about the covenants and promises made
to Abraham and his descendants, who are the house
of Israel. He taught that the Father will fulfill His
covenant to gather the house of Israel in the last
days. Read 3 Nephi 20:13, and note what knowledge
the house of Israel will gain as an essential part of
this gathering. Why do you think this knowledge is
essential?

Read 3 Nephi 20:25—26, and identify what the Savior
taught about how the descendants of Lehi were
blessed because of the covenant the Father made with
Abraham. The Savior emphasized that the Father sent

267
Him to visit the Nephites and save them from sin
“because [they were] the children of the covenant”
(3 Nephi 20:26).

2. Write in your scripture study journal about how you

have been blessed by the covenant you made with
Heavenly Father at baptism. Because you have been baptized a
member of the Church, you are the seed of Abraham and you
have a responsibility to help fulfill the covenant God made with
Abraham.

Read 3 Nephi 20:27, and mark phrases that teach
the following principle: As the seed of Abraham,
we have a covenant responsibility to bless all the
people of the earth.

As you read the following statement by
Elder David A. Bednar, look for how—as
the seed of Abraham—we are to bless
all the people of the earth: “You and I,
today and always, are to bless all peoples
in all the nations of the earth. You and I,
today and always, are to bear witness of Jesus Christ
and declare the message of the Restoration. You and
I, today and always, are to invite all to receive the
ordinances of salvation. Proclaiming the gospel is not
a part-time priesthood obligation. It is not simply an
activity in which we engage for a limited time or an
assignment we must complete as members of The
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Rather,
missionary work is a manifestation of our spiritual
identity and heritage. We were foreordained in the
premortal existence and born into mortality to fulfill
the covenant and promise God made to Abraham.
We are here upon the earth at this time to magnify the
priesthood and to preach the gospel. That is who we
are, and that is why we are here—today and always”
(“Becoming a Missionary,” 47).

3. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. What can you do now, as a youth, to bless others in the
world?

b. Why do you think it is important for you to understand that
you are of the seed of Abraham?

3 Nephi 21-22
Jesus Christ foretells the sign for the gathering of the
house of Israel in the last days

As recorded in 3 Nephi 21-22, the Savior taught the
Nephites many things about the last days—the time

268

when the gospel would be restored to the earth and
the Saints would prepare for His Second Coming.

4. To help you discover what the Savior taught about

the latter-day gathering of Israel, as recorded in 3 Nephi
21-22, read all of the scriptures in the left column of the
following chart. Then choose two of the questions in the right
column to answer in your scripture study journal.

a. When have you seen the
Book of Mormon lead
(or gather) someone, in-
cluding yourself, to Jesus
Christ and the covenants
of the gospel?

Read 3 Nephi 21:9. The
phrase “a great and a

Restoration of the gospel, and the mission of the
Prophet Joseph Smith to help this person receive the
blessings of the restored gospel. Also ponder how you
can encourage others to come to the Lord, including
those who were previously faithful in the gospel but
no longer are. If you think of a specific individual, set
a goal to act on the promptings you have received.

3 Nephi 23

Introduction

After quoting the words of Isaiah, Jesus Christ
commanded the Nephites to search the words of the
prophets. The Savior also corrected the Nephites for
not being diligent in their record keeping.

3 Nephi 23:1-5

Jesus Christ commands the people to search the words
of the prophets

Ponder your experiences with studying the scriptures
during this past year. Write a few words or short

phrases that describe blessings that have come into
your life as a result of your study of the scriptures.

As you look over your list, consider what these
blessings may teach you about the importance of
scripture study.

After quoting some of the teachings of Isaiah (see

3 Nephi 22), the Savior commanded the people

to diligently search the words of Isaiah and the
prophets. Read 3 Nephi 23:15, and identify why the
Savior said we should search the words of Isaiah and
the prophets. Consider marking words and phrases
that will help you remember what you learned.

One reason we are commanded to study the words
of Isaiah is because “he spake as touching all things
concerning [the Lord’s covenant] people which are
of the house of Israel” (8 Nephi 23:2). Because you
have made covenants with the Lord, you are part of
the house of Israel. Isaiah’s writings pertain to you.
Another reason we should study Isaiah’s words is
because they will all be fulfilled (see 3 Nephi 23:3).

Notice in 3 Nephi 23:1 that Jesus Christ specifically
commanded the Nephites to “search [the words of
Isaiah] diligently.”

1. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:
a. What do you think is the difference between reading the
words of the prophets and diligently searching them?
b. What scripture study methods can help you search the words
of Isaiah and the prophets effectively and meaningfully? (You
may want to review the lesson Unit 1: Day 1, “Studying the
Scriptures,” to remember some important scripture study helps.)

Elder Merrill J. Bateman, an emeritus member of the
Seventy, noted some blessings that come into our
lives as we search the words of the prophets: “There
are certain blessings obtained when one searches
the scriptures. As a person studies the words of the
Lord and obeys them, he or she draws closer to the
Savior and obtains a greater desire to live a righteous
life. The power to resist temptation increases, and
spiritual weaknesses are overcome. Spiritual wounds
are healed” (“Coming unto Christ by Searching the
Scriptures,” Ensign, Nov. 1992, 28).

Read 3 Nephi 23:5, and look for the promise the Savior
gave all of us if we study and act upon the invitations
in scripture.

2. Imagine you have a friend or family member who is

struggling to study the scriptures regularly. Using what you
learned in 3 Nephi 23:1—5, write what you might say to encourage
this person to study the words of the prophets diligently and have
a meaningful experience with the scriptures.

3 Nephi 23:6-14
Jesus Christ chastises His disciples for failing to record
important events

Read the following statement from President
Spencer W. Kimball:

“The Lord Jesus Christ Himself
emphasized the great importance of
record keeping to the Nephites and
Lamanites [see 3 Nephi 23:6-13]....

“Tam glad that it was not I who was
reprimanded, even though mildly and
kindly, for not having fulfilled the obligation to keep
my records up to date... .

“~.. Remember, the Savior chastised those who failed
to record important events” (“The Angels May Quote
from It,” New Era, Feb. 2003, 32, 34-35).

The remainder of 3 Nephi 23 contains the account
President Kimball described, when the Savior chastised
the Nephites for not including some important events
in their records. Read 3 Nephi 23:6-11, and identify
what the Nephites had failed to record. Why do you
think it was important for the Nephites to record

269
the fulfillment of this prophecy made by Samuel the
Lamanite? How does having that record in the Book
of Mormon help us in our day?

3. Answer the following question in your scripture study
journal: Why might it be important for you to write down
the spiritual events and promptings that occur in your life?

If there has been a recent spiritual event in your life
that you have failed to record, consider writing it in
your personal journal now. A simple notebook or pad
of paper is sufficient for keeping a personal journal.
Read 3 Nephi 23:12-14, and look for what the Savior
did after the Nephites obeyed the commandment to
write down the fulfillment of Samuel the Lamanite’s

prophecy.
The Savior “expounded all the scriptures,” which

means that He explained the meaning of the
scriptures.

Read 3 Nephi 24:1, and notice similarities between the
first part of this verse and what occurred in 3 Nephi
23:12-14. Notice that after the Nephites recorded
what Jesus Christ taught them, He gave them more
knowledge and revelation by expounding upon those
things.

Based upon what you have learned from 3 Nephi
23:6-14, complete the following principle: As I write
down sacred promptings and events, I invite

Among other possibilities, you could have completed
the above principle this way: As I write down sacred
promptings and events, I invite the Lord to give me
more revelation.

To more fully understand the truth you have
learned, read the following two statements from
Elder Richard G. Scott of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles:

“Knowledge carefully recorded is
knowledge available in time of need.
Spiritually sensitive information should be
kept in a sacred place that communicates
to the Lord how you treasure it. That
practice enhances the likelihood of

your receiving further light” (“Acquiring Spiritual
Knowledge,” Ensign, Nov. 1993, 88).

“Write down in a secure place the important things
you learn from the Spirit. You will find that as you
write down precious impressions, often more will
come. Also, the knowledge you gain will be available

270

throughout your life” (“To Acquire Knowledge and
the Strength to Use It Wisely,” Ensign, June 2002, 32).

4. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. Why do you think writing down the revelations we have
received from the Lord may help us receive more revelation?

b. How can taking time to write about the Lord's influence in
our lives help us feel grateful for our blessings and express our
gratitude to Him?

You may be concerned that you have not had special
or sacred experiences that would be valuable enough
to record. Elder John H. Groberg, an emeritus member
of the Seventy, addressed this concern: “Some people
say, ‘I don’t have anything to record. Nothing spiritual
happens to me.’ I say, ‘Start recording, and spiritual
things will happen. They are there all the time, but

we become more sensitive to them as we write’”
(“Writing Your Personal and Family History,” Ensign,
May 1980, 48).

You can begin to apply what you have learned about
recording spiritual experiences by carrying a piece of
paper, notebook, or journal with you for the next week.
Record any promptings, impressions, experiences, or
feelings you have throughout the week. Also record
how you feel impressed to act upon those promptings
you receive. After you have followed through with
those actions, write about your experience.

Tell someone (a family member, friend, or Church
leader) about your plan to keep a record of your
spiritual experiences. Consider inviting this person

to join you in this effort by recording some of his or
her own spiritual experiences. By inviting another
person to do this project with you, you can encourage
and report your progress to each other. However, you
should remember that it is not necessary—and may
not be appropriate—to share your sacred experiences
with one another.

3 Nephi 24-26

Introduction

In 3 Nephi 24—25, Jesus Christ fulfilled Heavenly
Father’s commandment to give the people some of the
prophecies of Malachi. Malachi had declared the need
for the house of Israel to repent and return to the Lord
in preparation for the Savior’s coming. As recorded

in 3 Nephi 26:3, Jesus Christ expounded unto the
people “all things, even from the beginning until the
time that he should come in his glory.” Mormon then
taught that those who believe the Book of Mormon
would have greater things manifested unto them (see
3 Nephi 26:9).

3 Nephi 24:1-6
Jesus Christ quotes the words given to Malachi regarding
the Second Coming

As He recited some of the prophecies of Malachi to the
Nephites, Jesus Christ referred to the images of fire and
soap. Imagine a glowing fire and a piece of soap. Think
about what these two objects might have in common as
purifying or cleansing agents.

Read 3 Nephi 24:2-3. In 3 Nephi 24:2, Jesus Christ is
compared to a refiner’s fire and fuller’s soap because
of what He will do at His Second Coming. In 3 Nephi
24:3, He is compared to a silversmith, who purifies
silver. To understand these verses, it is helpful to
know that the process for refining silver requires the
silversmith to hold a piece of silver over the hottest
part of the fire to burn away the impurities. The refiner
has to watch the silver closely, for if the silver is left
even a moment too long in the flames, it will be
destroyed. A fuller is a person who cleans garments
or whitens them using soap. The “sons of Levi” were
those who held the priesthood in ancient Israel; this
term can apply to all of the Lord’s people today.

Ponder what this imagery suggests will take place at
the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. In your scriptures
next to 3 Nephi 24:2—3, you may want to write: At His
Second Coming, Jesus Christ will purify His people.

Read 3 Nephi 24:5—6, and identify who will and who
will not be consumed or destroyed at the Savior’s
coming. (Note that in this passage the “sons of Jacob”
are the Lord’s covenant people in the house of Israel.)
These verses teach the principle: Jesus Christ will
judge the wicked at His coming.

1. Write the following heading in your scripture study

journal: What / must do to prepare for the Second Coming
of Jesus Christ. As you continue to study 3 Nephi 24-26, list
under this heading what you learn that will help you prepare for
the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.

3 Nephi 24:7-18
Malachi teaches the house of Israel how to return to the
Lord

Imagine that a close friend or family member does
not seem to be concerned about how a person’s
actions might affect him or her in the Judgment, the
Second Coming, or in eternity. Think about what you
might say to try and help this person. Read 3 Nephi
24:7, and identify what the Lord said to the sons of
Jacob who had begun to drift away from Him. What
do you think it means that the people had “gone
away” from the Lord’s ordinances?

In the Church, an ordinance is a sacred, formal

act performed by the authority of the priesthood.
Some ordinances are essential to our exaltation.

These ordinances are called “saving ordinances.”
They include baptism, confirmation, ordination to

the Melchizedek Priesthood (for men), the temple
endowment, and the marriage sealing. With each of
these ordinances, we enter into solemn covenants with
the Lord. You may want to list the saving ordinances

271
under the heading in journal assignment 1. Think
about how these ordinances help us prepare for the
Second Coming.

Although the Lord’s people had strayed from the
ordinances and covenants of the gospel, notice the
promise in 3 Nephi 24:7, which the Lord gave them if
they would return unto Him. You may want to mark this
promise in your scriptures to help you remember that if
we return unto the Lord, He will return unto us.

Read 3 Nephi 24:8-10, and look for one way that the
Lord indicated the sons of Jacob could return to Him
and thus prepare for the Second Coming. You may
want to include paying tithes and offerings in the list
under the heading in journal assignment 1.

Read the following counsel from President Gordon B.
Hinckley about paying tithing: “We can pay our tithing.
This is not so much a matter of money as it is a matter
of faith” (“Let Us Move This Work Forward,” Ensign,
Nov. 1985, 85).

Ponder for a moment how your willingness to give
tithes and offerings to the Lord is an indication of your
faith in Him. Read 3 Nephi 24:10-12, and focus on the
blessings for those who pay a full and honest tithe.

2. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. What blessings have you received from obedience to the law
of tithing?

b. How do you think keeping the commandment to pay your
tithes and offerings has helped you to spiritually prepare yourself
for the Second Coming?

Some people in ancient Israel murmured that keeping
the Lord’s commandments had not done them any
good. They felt that their efforts were in vain, or
pointless (see 3 Nephi 24:14). On the other hand, they
argued that the proud and wicked were “happy,” “set
up,” and “delivered” (3 Nephi 24:15). In other words,
these people claimed that the wicked were better

off than the righteous. The Lord responded to these
complaints by saying that those who fear the Lord and
think upon His name, and who meet together often to
speak one to another, would find their names written
in “a book of remembrance” (3 Nephi 24:16). They
would be the ones who were prepared for the Lord’s
coming and be spared as His own treasured “jewels”
(see 3 Nephi 24:16-17).The Lord challenged those
who complained to wait and observe the end result
when they could then “return and discern between the
righteous and the wicked” (3 Nephi 24:18). They will
see that the righteous are much better off in the end.

272

3 Nephi 25

Jesus Christ quotes Malachi's prophecy that Elijah would
return prior to the Second Coming

Read 3 Nephi 25:1-3, and look for why the Second
Coming will be a blessing to those who are faithful

to Jesus Christ. The word root in verse 1 refers to
ancestors, and branch refers to posterity. Thus, in

the next life the wicked will not enjoy the blessings

of being sealed to either their ancestors or to their
posterity. The calves that “grow up ...in the stall” are
a symbol for children who are protected, cared for, and
have all things necessary for them as they grow up.

The Savior shared with the Nephites what Malachi
wrote about an event that would take place before the
Second Coming and would involve the Old Testament
prophet Elijah. Read 3 Nephi 25:5—6, and look for what
Malachi taught that Elijah would do to help prepare
the world for the Lord’s coming.

Elijah’s return to the earth was an essential part of

the Restoration of the gospel. On April 3, 1836, Elijah
appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in

the newly dedicated Kirtland Temple (see D&C 110).
He conferred upon them the sealing power of the
priesthood, making it possible for families to be sealed
throughout the generations. What do you think the
statement that “he shall turn the heart of the fathers
to the children, and the heart of the children to their

fathers” (3 Nephi 25:6) means?

These verses teach that as our hearts are turned to
our fathers, we are helping to prepare the earth for
the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.
3. Write in your scripture study journal an experience

you or your family members have had that has helped
you turn your heart to your ancestors. This might include being
sealed in the holy temple, researching your family history, or
participating in baptisms for the dead. If you cannot think of an
experience, write a short paragraph about your desire to
participate in this work. (Under journal assignment 1, you may
want to write: receiving temple ordinances for yourself and your
family, attending the temple, and gathering family history
information.)

3 Nephi 26

What must be done to receive the greater things that
Jesus Christ revealed

We learn from 3 Nephi 26:3 that the Savior taught the
Nephites “all things which should come upon the face
of the earth.” Read 3 Nephi 26:6-8, looking for how
much of the Savior’s sermon was recorded in the Book
of Mormon. Study 3 Nephi 26:9-11 to find out why
Mormon did not include everything.

The Lord directed Mormon to include only a small
portion of those teachings in order to try our faith.
From 3 Nephi 26:1-21 we learn that as we believe
what God has revealed, we prepare ourselves
to receive greater revelation. Why do you think
believing the truths we have already received is
essential before we receive additional truth? (See
Alma 12:9-11.) How can we show that we believe
what the Lord has revealed?

4. To apply the bolded principle above, respond to the

following question in your scripture study journal: What
are you doing in your life to demonstrate your belief in the Book
of Mormon?

As recorded in the rest of 3 Nephi 26, Mormon
summarized the Savior’s ministry and its effect on

the Nephites. Read 3 Nephi 26:13-21, and consider
marking how the people put the words of Jesus Christ
into practice.

5. Write the following note at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture study journal:

Additional questions, thoughts, and insights | would like to share
with my teacher:

3 Nephi 27

Introduction

Early in their ministry, after the second day of the
resurrected Savior’s appearance among them, the
twelve Nephite disciples met together in mighty
prayer and fasting. Jesus Christ again appeared to
them and answered their question about what the
name of the Church should be. The Savior taught
them that the Atonement is the essence of His gospel
and that through the Atonement we may stand
spotless before Him as we repent, are baptized, and
endure to the end. In addition, He commanded His
disciples to be like Him.

3 Nephi 27:1-12

The Lord teaches the twelve disciples that His Church
should bear His name

Imagine that you wanted to start a new club or sports
team. Decide what type of club or team you would
create, and then choose a name for your organization.

Write down both the name and the kind of
organization you chose:

Think about some organizations you know about and
what their names signify about their purpose and the
people who belong to them.

The twelve Nephite disciples continued to teach and
baptize the people. On one occasion they were united
in fasting and prayer when the Savior again visited
them (see 3 Nephi 27:1-2). Read 3 Nephi 27:3-7,
looking for the question the disciples asked and the
Savior’s answer. You may wish to mark the reasons
Jesus Christ gave for calling the Church in His name.

Search 3 Nephi 27:8—10, and mark what the Savior
taught were indicators of His true Church. Finish the
following phrase in your manual to indicate several key
features of the true Church:

The true Church of Jesus Christ is

273
THE CHURCH OF

JESUS CHRIST

OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS

Think about why it is important that the true Church
of Jesus Christ not only bears His name but is also
built on His gospel (see 3 Nephi 27:8-10). The Savior
promised the Nephites that if the Church is built upon
His gospel, then Heavenly Father will show forth

His works in it (see 3 Nephi 27:10). Ponder how you
personally have seen Heavenly Father show His works
in the Church.

1. In your scripture study journal, write Being a member

of the true Church of Jesus Christ is important to me
because... Then write a short paragraph describing your
thoughts on the phrase. Try to include as many reasons as you
can from what you learned while studying 3 Nephi 27:1-12.

3 Nephi 27:13-22
Jesus Christ defines His gospel and teaches what we must
do to stand guiltless before Him

Think of a time when you were caught doing
something you knew was wrong. Recall how you felt
when the truth about what you had done became
known. Ponder the following questions: How would
you feel standing before the Lord to be judged if there
were still some wrong deeds you had not repented of?
How would you feel standing before the Lord to be
judged if there was no way to repent of any of the sins
you committed during your life?

After teaching the Nephites that His Church must be
built upon His gospel, the Savior went on to teach
them what His gospel is. The word gospel literally
means “good news” or “glad tidings.” Through the
gospel there is still good news for all of us if we sin.

2. Read 3 Nephi 27:13-16, 19, and look for elements

of the gospel that are good news for all of us. The
foundation of the gospel of Jesus Christ is that He did the
will of His Father in accomplishing the Atonement. Answer
the following questions in your scripture study journal:

a. The Savior testified to His disciples that He came into the
world to do the will of His Father. According to 3 Nephi 27:14,
what was Heavenly Father's will for His Holy Son?

b. Because the Savior fulfilled the will of His Father, what is
available for all mankind? (see especially 3 Nephi 27:19).

274

3. To help you appreciate the greatness of this good

news, read one or more of the following scripture
passages and write a brief explanation in your scripture study
journal about why the Atonement of Jesus Christ is such good
news: 2 Nephi 9:8—-10; Alma 34:1 4-16; Helaman 14:15-18.

Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles testified about why the gospel is good news
for all people: “The ‘good news’ was that death and
hell could be escaped, that mistakes and sins could be
overcome, that there was hope, that there was help,
that the insoluble was solved, that the enemy had been
conquered. The good news was that everyone's tomb
could one day be empty, that everyone’s soul could again
be pure, that every child of God could again return to
the Father who gave them life” (“Missionary Work and
the Atonement,” Ensign, Mar. 2001, 8, 10).

Have you ever heard someone say that we need to
“live the gospel”? When someone invites us to “live
the gospel,” they are usually inviting us to live the
principles and receive the ordinances that invite the
power of Jesus Christ’s Atonement into our lives so
we can be saved. Search 3 Nephi 27:20—21 looking
for what we must do to receive all the blessings of
the Atonement and prepare for judgment.

4. Write If we , then we

will be able to stand spotless before Jesus Christ in
your scripture study journal. Complete this phrase by writing in a
gospel principle from 3 Nephi 27:20-21 that we must follow in
order to stand spotless before the Lord. (You might identify

several principles for the “if” part of this principle statement.)
Then answer the following question in your scripture study
journal: What can | do in my life right now to “live the gospel”
more fully so that | can experience the power of the Atonement
and stand spotless before God at the last day?

Ponder what it will be like one day to stand before
Jesus Christ knowing that you have been made clean
through His Atonement by obedience to the principles,
commandments, and ordinances of His gospel.

3 Nephi 27:23-33
Jesus Christ instructs His disciples to be like He is

As recorded at the end of 3 Nephi 27, Jesus Christ gave
instructions to His twelve disciples and taught them
about their role as leaders and judges of their people.
Read 3 Nephi 27:27, and look for the commandment
He gave the disciples to help them righteously fulfill
their roles. Take a moment and think about the
following questions:

e Why would it be important for those who judge
others to be like the Savior?

¢ Referring back to 3 Nephi 27:21, what did the Savior
command the disciples to do?

e What is the relationship between doing the works
of the Savior and becoming like Him?

Reread 3 Nephi 27:21, 27, and mark in your scriptures
words and phrases that show that the Lord expects
His disciples to emulate His works and become as
He is.

5. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal to help you apply the Savior's teachings to
be more like Him:

a. What opportunities did | have yesterday to be like the Savior?
b. How could | be more like the Savior today?

c. What works of the Savior could | do tomorrow at school or
at home?

President Ezra Taft Benson taught that
those who strive to become like Jesus
Christ achieve true greatness: “That man
is greatest and most blessed and joyful
whose life most closely approaches the
pattern of the Christ. This has nothing
to do with earthly wealth, power, or prestige. The
only true test of greatness, blessedness, joyfulness is
how close a life can come to being like the Master,
Jesus Christ. He is the right way, the full truth,

and the abundant life” (“Jesus Christ—Gifts and
Expectations,” Ensign, Dec. 1988, 2).

6. Write the following note at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture study journal:

Additional questions, thoughts, and insights | would like to share
with my teacher:

3 Nephi 28-30

Introduction

Prior to His departure, Jesus Christ asked each of His
twelve disciples what they desired of Him. Nine of
them requested to speedily return to Him when their
ministry on the earth was complete. Three asked to
remain on the earth to continue working to bring
souls to Christ until He returns. The Lord honored
both of these righteous desires. Mormon provided
some details concerning the Three Nephites’ ministry
upon the earth.

275
As Mormon concluded his account of the Savior’s visit
among the Nephites, he explained that the coming
forth of the Book of Mormon would be a sign that
the Lord was fulfilling His covenant with the house
of Israel. Concluding 3 Nephi, Mormon recorded the
words of Jesus Christ, inviting all people to repent and
be numbered with the house of Israel.

3 Nephi 28:1-11
Jesus Christ grants the desires of His twelve disciples

Ponder how you would respond if Jesus Christ
appeared to you and asked, “What is it that ye desire
of me?”

Briefly write which of your righteous desires you would
share with Him.

Read 3 Nephi 28:1-3, and look for how nine of the
Nephite disciples responded when the Lord asked
them, “What is it that ye desire of me?” Notice how
the Savior felt about their desire.

Read 3 Nephi 28:4—7, and look for what the remaining
three disciples desired of the Savior. Notice how Jesus
Christ felt about the desire of these three disciples.
Ponder why you think the Lord said they were “more
blessed” because of their desire.

Read 3 Nephi 28:8-10 to see how the Savior described
the blessings the Three Nephites would receive
because of their desires to labor among mortal men.
Consider writing the following truth in the margin of
your scriptures or in your scripture study journal: The
Lord blesses us according to our righteous desires.
Read the following statement from Elder Neal A.
Maxwell of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles to see
the importance of righteous desires:

“What we insistently desire, over time, is
what we will eventually become and what
we will receive in eternity. . . .

“Righteous desires need to be relentless,
ft therefore, because, said President
Brigham Young, ‘the men and women,
who desire to obtain seats in the celestial kingdom,
will find that they must battle every day’ (in Journal of
Discourses, 11:14)” (“According to the Desire of [Our]
Hearts,” Ensign, Nov. 1996, 21-22).

1. Answer one or both of the following questions in your
scripture study journal:

a. When have you felt blessed by the Lord as you acted on your
righteous desires?

b. What will you start doing today to nurture righteous desires
in your own life so you can qualify for the Lord’s blessings?

276

3 Nephi 28:12-35
Mormon describes the ministry of the Three Nephites

Many people have heard legends, myths, and rumors
about supposed visits of the Three Nephites. Rather
than rely on fables, find out what the scriptures say
their mission is and how they are able to minister with
power “as the angels of God” (3 Nephi 28:30).

Read 3 Nephi 28:12-17 to learn what happened to the
Three Nephites. According to 3 Nephi 28:15, what was
one reason the disciples needed to go through this

change?

Read 3 Nephi 28:18—23, looking for how the Lord
blessed the Three Nephites so they could carry out
their righteous desires. Think of what these verses
teach us about the Lord’s willingness to bless us as
we live according to our righteous desires.

Study 3 Nephi 28:25-31, and identify who has
benefitted and will yet benefit from the ministry of the
Three Nephites. You may want to mark what you find.

3 Nephi 28:36-40
Mormon learns about the nature of translated beings

Think of a time you had a question about the gospel
or a challenge that you were facing. Read 3 Nephi
28:36, and look for what Mormon did not understand
about the physical condition of the Three Nephites
after the change they experienced. Ponder your answer
to the following question: Who do you normally turn
to when you have a question about the gospel? Read
3 Nephi 28:36—37 to learn what Mormon did to find
the answer to his question.

Study 3 Nephi 28:37—40, and look for what Mormon
learned about the change that occurred to the bodies
of the Three Nephites. The state or condition enjoyed
by the Three Nephites is called “translation,” which
is like transfiguration (see 3 Nephi 28:17) only longer
in duration. Translated beings are still mortal, but, as
the Prophet Joseph Smith taught, their physical bodies
have been changed from a telestial condition to a
terrestrial condition; they are freed from the physical
sufferings of their mortal bodies (see History of the
Church, 4:210). Translated beings can appear and
disappear as they choose and according to God’s will
(see 3 Nephi 28:27-30). They assist in bringing souls
to salvation, and they remain in a translated state
until the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, when they
will undergo another change to become resurrected,
glorified personages (see 3 Nephi 28:7-8, 39-40).

From Mormon’s experience, we learn that if we
inquire of the Lord for understanding, we will
receive revelation. You may want to write this
principle in your scriptures or scripture study journal.

2. In your scripture study journal, record an experience
in which you or someone you know sought the Lord for
answers through heartfelt prayer.

3 Nephi 29

Mormon testifies that the Lord will fulfill His covenant
with the house of Israel in the last days

After Mormon wrote about the Savior’s visit to the
people of the Book of Mormon, he prophesied of the
fulfillment of the Lord’s promises in the last days.
Ponder your answer to the following question: When
have you learned of or witnessed the fulfillment of
one of God’s promises?

Consider marking the words when and then as you
study 3 Nephi 29:1-3. These words will help you
identify an event that signifies the Lord is keeping
His promises to the house of Israel in the last days.
(The phrase “these sayings” in 3 Nephi 29:1 refers
to the writings of the Book of Mormon.)

We learn from 3 Nephi 29:1-3 that the coming forth
of the Book of Mormon is a sign that the Lord is
fulfilling His covenant with the house of Israel.

The Book of Mormon assures us that the Lord is
preparing His people for His coming (see 3 Nephi
29:2). As you read the following statement from
Elder Russell M. Nelson of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles, mark how the Book of Mormon helps us
prepare for the Savior’s coming:

“The Book of Mormon is a tangible sign that the Lord
has commenced to gather His children of covenant
Israel... .

“Indeed, the Lord has not forgotten! He has blessed
us and others throughout the world with the Book

of Mormon... . It helps us to make covenants with
God. It invites us to remember Him and to know His
Beloved Son. It is another testament of Jesus Christ”
(“Covenants,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2011, 88).

3. Read 3 Nephi 29:4—6, and do one or both of the
following activities in your scripture study journal:

a. Identify three specific Book of Mormon passages that you
think can help someone come unto Jesus Christ. For each
passage, write a sentence or two explaining why you chose that
passage.

b. Write a paragraph about how you think the Book of Mormon
could help someone understand and accept the gifts of
revelation, prophecy, and tongues or the power of the Holy
Ghost.

3 Nephi 30
The Lord exhorts the Gentiles to repent and come unto Him

Mormon concluded his record of the Savior’s ministry
by writing some specific instructions he received from
Jesus Christ concerning the Gentiles. Read 3 Nephi
30:1-2, and consider marking as many of the Savior’s
instructions to the Gentiles as you can find. Consider
also marking the blessings available to the Gentiles

if they will come unto Christ. Although 3 Nephi 30:2
is addressed to those outside of the Church, we can
use Jesus Christ’s invitation to measure our own
willingness to live the requirements of His covenant.

4. Write the following principle in your scripture study

journal: ff we come unto Christ, we can be numbered
among His people. Write in your scripture study journal why it
is a blessing of the Lord to be “numbered with [His] people who
are of the house of Israel” (3 Nephi 30:2).

5. Write the following note at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture study journal:

INTRODUCTION TO
4 Nephi

Why Study This Book?

In your study of 4 Nephi, you will witness the blessings
that come to people who are united in living the gospel
of Jesus Christ. The book reveals that all the people
throughout the land were converted during the Savior’s
ministry among them. By obeying the commandments,
they enjoyed peace, prosperity, and marvelous spiritual
blessings. Mormon declared: “Surely there could not be
a happier people among all the people who had been
created by the hand of God” (4 Nephi 1:16). You will
also learn important lessons from this people’s gradual
decline into a state of gross wickedness.

Who Wrote This Book?

Mormon compiled and abridged the records of four
other writers to create the book of 4 Nephi. The first of
these was Nephi, for whom the book was named. Nephi
was the son of Nephi who was one of the 12 disciples
chosen by the Lord during His ministry among the
descendants of Lehi (see 3 Nephi 11:18-22; 12:1). The
other three writers were Amos the son of Nephi, Amos
the son of Amos, and Ammaron the brother of Amos
(see 4 Nephi 1:19, 21, 47).

When and Where Was It Written?

The original records used as sources for 4 Nephi were
likely written between A.D. 34 and A.D. 321. Mormon
abridged those records sometime between A.D. 345
and A.D. 385. Mormon did not record where he was
when he compiled this book.

278

4 Nephi 1

Introduction

After Jesus Christ’s visit and ministry in the Americas,
the people applied His teachings and enjoyed 200 years
of unity, prosperity, and happiness. Eventually, however,
the people began to be prideful and became increasingly
wicked. Soon they became divided into Nephites and
Lamanites again, and after 300 years, both the Nephites
and Lamanites had become wicked, with only a few
righteous people remaining.

4 Nephi 1:1-18
The people were all converted and experienced peace
and happiness

What helps you be truly happy?

What do you think is the difference between things
that bring you temporary happiness and things that
can lead to lasting happiness? Read 4 Nephi 1:16

to find what Mormon wrote about the people after
the Savior visited them. You might want to mark the
phrase “surely there could not be a happier people.”

1. Write the heading There Could Not Be a Happier

People in your scripture study journal, and draw a circle
underneath it, as shown in the following diagram. (You will be
writing things inside and around the circle.) Read 4 Nephi 1:1-2,
and look for what the people did that made their happiness
possible. List your findings in the circle.

There Could Not Be a Happier People

Because the people applied the Savior’s teachings, they
“were all converted unto the Lord” (4 Nephi 1:2) and
enjoyed great happiness.
Elder Richard G. Scott of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles explained how conversion and happiness are
linked together. As you read his words, underline what
it means to be converted:

“Your happiness now and forever is
conditioned on your degree of conversion
and the transformation that it brings

to your life. How then can you become
truly converted? President [Marion G.]
Romney describes the steps you must
follow:

“Membership in the Church and conversion are

not necessarily synonymous. Being converted and
having a testimony are not necessarily the same thing
either. A testimony comes when the Holy Ghost gives
the earnest seeker a witness of the truth. A moving
testimony vitalizes faith. That is, it induces repentance
and obedience to the commandments. Conversion is
the fruit or the reward for repentance and obedience’
[in Conference Report, Guatemala Area Conference
1977, 8-9].

*

“Stated simply, true conversion is the fruit of faith,
repentance, and consistent obedience. . . .

“True conversion yields the fruit of enduring happiness
that can be enjoyed even when the world is in turmoil
and most are anything but happy” (“Full Conversion
Brings Happiness,” Ensign, May 2002, 25-26).

2. Read 4 Nephi 1:2-3, 5, 7, 10-13, 15-18, and look

for words and phrases that describe what the people
experienced because everyone was converted to the Lord. In
your scripture study journal, write some of these words and
phrases around the outside of the circle you drew in the
previous assignment.

We can learn from this period of unprecedented
happiness and prosperity among the Nephites that
when a group of people is converted to the Lord,
it brings unity and happiness. You may want to
write this principle in your scriptures near 4 Nephi
1:16 or in your scripture study journal.

Ponder what you think it would be like if everyone
around you were truly converted to the Lord.

279
3. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. What benefits do you think would come to your family
if everyone in your family lived like the people in 4 Nephi?

b. Think about a time in your life when you have been blessed
by being a part of a group that was unified in righteousness—
such as in your family, quorum or class, or group of friends. What
do you think helped this group to be unified in righteousness?
What blessings did you and those who were with you receive?

4 Nephi 1:19-49
Wickedness returns and spreads until only a few righteous
people remain

What do you think could destroy a happy society like
the people described in 4 Nephi had?

4. Write the heading “Destruction of a Happy Society”

in your scripture study journal, and draw a circle
underneath, similar to your diagram in the first assignment.
Read 4 Nephi 1:20, 23-24, and look for what began to destroy
the happiness and peace of the people. Write your findings in
the circle.

You may want to write the following statement by
President Henry B. Eyring of the First Presidency in
your scriptures next to 4 Nephi 1:24 or in your scripture
study journal: “Pride is the great enemy of unity” (“Our
Hearts Knit as One,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2008, 70).

In what ways do you think pride is the enemy of unity?

The following statement from President Dieter F.

Uchtdorf of the First Presidency gives insight into
pride. Underline phrases that explain why pride is
so destructive.

“Pride is sinful... because it breeds hatred or
hostility and places us in opposition
to God and our fellowmen. At its
core, pride is a sin of comparison, for

wonderful I am and what great things I
have done,’ it always seems to end with
‘Therefore, | am better than you.’

“When our hearts are filled with pride, we commit a
grave sin, for we violate the two great commandments

280

though it usually begins with “Look how

[see Matthew 22:36—40]. Instead of worshipping God
and loving our neighbor, we reveal the real object of
our worship and love—the image we see in the mirror”
(“Pride and the Priesthood,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov.
2010, 56).

5. Read 4 Nephi 1:25-27, 30-35, 38-45, and look

for words and phrases that describe the effects of pride
among the people. Write these words and phrases around the
outside of the circle in your scripture study journal for
assignment 4.

One truth we can learn from these events is that the
sin of pride creates division and leads to greater
wickedness. You may want to write this phrase in
your scriptures. How can the pride of one or two
people affect the happiness of the entire group?

Consider who in the following scenarios might be
negatively affected by an individual's pride:

e A member of a class in Young Women does not want
to listen to the lesson her teacher has prepared about
the blessings that come from obeying the Word of
Wisdom. She feels she does not need to be lectured
again about the Word of Wisdom and becomes
disruptive and refuses to participate in class.

e A friend consistently teases or belittles another
member of the group because the way that person
dresses shows he or she does not have much money.

6. Ponder whether or not there are elements of pride

in your own life. It may be helpful to review President
Uchtdorf’s statement as you ponder. Think of what you can do to
resist pride and to seek help in increasing unity and righteousness
in your family, quorum, class, or group of friends. Write your
thoughts and goals in your scripture study journal.

7. Write the following at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture study journal:

| have studied 4 Nephi 1 and completed this lesson on (date).

INTRODUCTION TO

Mormon

Why Study This Book?

As you study the book of Mormon, you will learn
valuable lessons from Mormon, who lived faithfully
as a disciple of Jesus Christ even though he was
surrounded throughout his life by “a continual scene
of wickedness and abominations” (Mormon 2:18).
You will also benefit from studying the words of
Moroni, Mormon’s son, who testified to latter-day
readers, “Jesus Christ hath shown you unto me, and |
know your doing” (Mormon 8:35). By studying these
writings you can learn the importance of choosing to
live according to the commandments and covenants
of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

Who Wrote This Book?

Mormon wrote the first seven chapters of this book
as a brief account of the wickedness and wars among
the Nephites and Lamanites in his day. He also made
“a full account” of events from his lifetime upon the
large plates of Nephi. (see Mormon 2:18; 5:9.) When
Mormon was “about ten years of age,” the record
keeper Ammaron informed him that eventually he
would have the responsibility to record “all the things
that [he] observed concerning this people” (Mormon
1:2, 4). At about age 24, he gained custody of the
plates of Nephi and made “a record according to the
words of Ammaron” (Mormon 2:17). Later, Mormon
began abridging the large plates of Nephi, which
included writings from prophets and record keepers
from Lehi through Ammaron. Near the end of his life,
Mormon “hid up in the hill Cumorah all the records
which had been entrusted to [him] by the hand of
the Lord,” except for a few plates that he gave to his
son Moroni (Mormon 6:6). He then led the Nephites
in their last great battle against the Lamanites.
Before Mormon died, he directed Moroni to complete
his record. Moroni added the writings comprising
chapters 8-9 of this book.

When and Where Was It Written?

Mormon likely wrote Mormon 1-7 between A.D. 345
and A.D. 401 (see Mormon 2:15-17; 8:5-6). He finished
his writings after the final great battle between the
Nephites and the Lamanites at Cumorah (see Mormon
6:10-11). Moroni probably wrote Mormon 8-9 between
the years A.D. 401 and A.D. 421 as he wandered for the
safety of his life (see Mormon 8:4-6; Moroni 1:1-3).

Mormon 1-2

Introduction

Although Mormon grew up ina time of great
wickedness, he chose to be faithful. Because of his
faithfulness, he was called to care for the records of
the Nephites. When he was 15 years old, Mormon
was “visited of the Lord, and tasted and knew of the
goodness of Jesus” (Mormon 1:15). In the same year,
the Nephites appointed him to lead their armies (see
Mormon 2:1). He desired to help the Nephites repent,
but because of their willful rebellion, he was forbidden
by the Lord to preach to them. The Nephites lost the
gift of the Holy Ghost and other gifts of God and
were left to their own strength as they battled the
Lamanites.

Mormon 1:1-5
Mormon is given charge of the sacred records

What are some words you would like people to use
when they describe you?

Have you ever been described as a Mormon? What
does it mean to you to have someone describe you as
a Mormon?

President Gordon B. Hinckley spoke about the
nickname Mormon, which some people use when
referring to members of The Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints:

“While [sometimes regret that people
do not call this church by its proper
name, | am happy that the nickname
they use is one of great honor made
so by a remarkable man and a book
which gives an unmatched testimony
concerning the Redeemer of the world.

“Anyone who comes to know the man Mormon,
through the reading and pondering of his words,
anyone who reads this precious trove of history which
was assembled and preserved in large measure by
him, will come to know that Mormon is not a word

of disrepute, but that it represents the greatest good—
that good which is of God” (“Mormon Should Mean
‘More Good,’” Ensign, Nov. 1990, 52-53).

Mormon, the prophet, was born in a time when almost
everyone in the land was living in wickedness. At this
time a prophet named Ammaron was commanded to

281
hide up all of the sacred records (see 4 Nephi 1:47—-49).
Ammaron visited the then 10-year-old boy Mormon
and gave him instructions concerning his future
responsibility with the records. Read Mormon 1:2, and
look for words or phrases Ammaron used to describe
young Mormon.

One word Ammaron used to describe Mormon was
sober. The word sober means serious, solemn, righteous,
or godly. You may want to write this definition in the
margin of your scriptures. What topics or situations
in life do you think you should be sober about? It

is important to understand that sober people can
have fun and laugh, but they understand when

it is appropriate to be lighthearted and when it is
appropriate to be more serious.

Ammaron also described Mormon as being “quick to
observe” (Mormon 1:2). What do you think it means
to be quick to observe? Elder David A. Bednar of the
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles explained that the
word observe is used in the scriptures in two ways:

282

“TA] seemingly simple and perhaps underappreciated
spiritual gift—the capacity of being ‘quick to observe’
(Mormon 1:2)—is vitally important for you and for me
in the world in which we do now and will yet live... .

“Please consider the significance of this important
spiritual gift. As used in the scriptures, the word observe
has two primary uses. One use denotes ‘to look’ or ‘to
see’ or ‘to notice’—as we learn in Isaiah 42:20. . ..

“The second use of the word observe suggests ‘to obey’
or ‘to keep’—as is evident in [Doctrine and Covenants
54:6]... .

“Thus when we are quick to observe, we promptly
look or notice and obey. Both of these fundamental
elements—looking and obeying—are essential to
being quick to observe. And the prophet Mormon is
an impressive example of this gift in action” (“Quick
to Observe,” Ensign, Dec. 2006, 31-32).

1. In your scripture study journal, write your thoughts
about how this character trait of being quick to observe
could help you in your everyday life.

Read Mormon 1:3-5, and identify Ammaron’s
instructions to Mormon. How might Mormon’s
character traits of being sober and quick to observe
help him with these responsibilities?

Mormon 1:6-19

Mormon is forbidden by the Lord to preach because
of the people's willful rebellion

Have you ever lost something very valuable? While
still in his youth, Mormon witnessed a number of
battles between the Nephites and the Lamanites

and the spread of great wickedness upon the land
(see Mormon 1:6-13). Because the wickedness of the
Nephites became so great, Mormon recorded that they
lost many precious gifts from the Lord.

2. Make two columns in your scripture study journal.

Title the first column ” Gifts the Nephites Lost.” Read
Mormon 1:13-14, 18, and look for what gifts the Lord took
from the Nephites. Write your findings in the first column. Title
the second column “Why the Lord Took His Gifts Away.” Read
Mormon 1:14, 16-17, 19, and look for reasons why the Lord
took His gifts from the Nephites. Write your findings in the
second column.
From these verses we can learn that wickedness
and unbelief drive away gifts of the Lord and
the influence of the Holy Ghost. Even though the
Nephites’ rebellion was extreme, this principle also
applies to us individually when we disobey any of
God’s commandments.

If you had lived in Mormon’s time, which of the gifts
of God mentioned in Mormon 1:13-14, 18 would you
most regret losing?

Read Mormon 1:15, and look for what Mormon was
experiencing while the rest of the Nephites were losing
the gift of the Holy Ghost and other gifts of God.
How do you think Mormon was able to have spiritual
experiences even though he was in the midst of great
wickedness?

Mormon 2:1-15

Mormon leads the Nephite armies and sorrows over their
wickedness

Consider the following scenario: A 30-year-old man
lives at home with his parents and chooses not to look
for work. Instead, he lives off of his parents’ labors
and wastes his time in unproductive activities such

as spending most of his time playing video games.
Contrast this scenario with the description of the boy
Mormon as you study Mormon 2.

Read Mormon 2:1-2, and look for what responsibility
Mormon was given and how old he was when he
received it.

Not long after Mormon’s appointment as leader of
the Nephite armies, the Lamanite army came upon
the Nephites with such force that the Nephites were
frightened and retreated. The Lamanites drove them
from city to city until the Nephites gathered in one
place. Eventually, Mormon’s army withstood the
Lamanites and caused them to flee (see Mormon
2:3-9).

3. Read Mormon 2:10-15, and look for the spiritual
condition of the Nephites after these battles. Then answer
the following questions in your scripture study journal:

a. Why were the Nephites sorrowing?

b. According to Mormon 2:14, how did Mormon know that their
sorrow was not an indication of true repentance?

c. What differences can you see in Mormon 2:13-14 between
those who sorrowed unto repentance and those whose sorrow
led to damnation (being stopped in their progression)?

These verses teach that if our sorrow for sin is unto
repentance, it will lead us to come unto Christ
with a humble heart. They also illustrate the principle
that sorrow only for the consequences of sin leads
to damnation (or being stopped in our progress
toward eternal life).

4. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. How might someone who has sinned show worldly sorrow—
the kind of sorrow that leads to damnation?

b. How might someone who has sinned manifest the kind of
sorrow that leads to repentance?

Ponder how you respond when you realize you have
made mistakes or sinned. If you come unto the Savior
with a humble heart and repent, you can experience
peace and be reconciled to God.

Mormon 2:16-29

Mormon obtains the plates and records an account
of the wickedness of his people

As battles with the Lamanites continued, Mormon
found himself near the hill where Ammaron had
hidden the Nephite records. He removed the plates
of Nephi and began to record what he had observed
among the people since the time he was a child

(see Mormon 2:16-18). Read Mormon 2:18-19, and
mark some of the phrases that describe the spiritual
conditions that Mormon grew up with.

From what you have learned about Mormon, why do
you think he was confident that he would be “lifted
up at the last day”? (Mormon 2:19). (In this context,
“lifted up at the last day” means to be exalted—
resurrected with a celestial body and brought into the
presence of God to remain with Him forever.)

Mormons life is a testimony that we can choose to
live righteously even in a wicked society.

Consider the following counsel: “You are responsible
for the choices you make. God is mindful of you and
will help you make good choices, even if your family
and friends use their agency in ways that are not right.
Have the moral courage to stand firm in obeying God’s
will, even if you have to stand alone. As you do this, you
set an example for others to follow” (For the Strength of
Youth [booklet, 2011], 2).

283
5. In your scripture study journal, write about a time

when you saw a friend or family member stand firm in
obeying God's will even when others were not. Also write your
thoughts about how that person's example and Mormon’s
example are helpful to you.

The Young Women motto is “Stand for Truth and
Righteousness.” Whether you are a young woman or a
young man, think of a specific area of your life in which
you can be more determined to stand for what is right.
The Lord will help you as you strive to stand for what is
right even when others around you might not.

Mormon 3-6

Introduction

After retaking their lands from the Lamanites, the
Nephites again prepared for battle. Mormon pled
with the Nephites to repent; instead, they boasted in
their own strength and swore to avenge their fallen
brethren. Because the Lord had forbidden His people
to seek revenge, Mormon refused to lead their army,
and they were defeated. As the Nephites persisted

in wickedness, God poured out His judgments upon
them and the Lamanites began to sweep them from
the earth. Eventually, Mormon returned to lead the
Nephites in battle, but because they refused to repent,
they were destroyed by the Lamanites. Mormon
lamented their fall and their unwillingness to return
to Jesus Christ. He prophesied that the record of the
people would come forth in the last days, and he
encouraged those who would read it to repent and
prepare for their own judgment before God.

284

Mormon 3-4

Because the Nephites increase in wickedness, Mormon
refuses to lead their armies, and the Lamanites begin to
sweep the Nephites off the earth

Have you ever felt that the Lord wanted you to
change something in your life? Do you think He has
encouraged or helped you to change something in
your life without you realizing it?

During Mormon’s time, the Nephites often failed to
realize or appreciate how the Lord was influencing
their battles with the Lamanites. After the Nephites
made a treaty with the Lamanites and Gadianton
robbers, the Lord let them experience 10 years without
conflict. During those years they prepared physically
for coming attacks (see Mormon 2:28; 3:1).

Read Mormon 3:2-3, and look for a more important
way in which the Lord wanted the Nephites to prepare
themselves for the Lamanite attacks. How did the
Nephites respond? According to Mormon 3:3, why had
the Lord spared the Nephites in their recent battles
despite their wickedness?

As recorded in Mormon 3:4-8, the Lord protected the
Nephites twice more in battle. One doctrinal truth we
can learn from the Lord’s dealings with the wicked
Nephite nation is that in His mercy, the Lord gives
us sufficient opportunities to repent of our sins.
These opportunities are evidence of God’s patience
and kindness and of His desire that all of His children
live in such a way as to qualify for the full blessings of
the Atonement.

1. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal (you may answer them in your personal
journal if the answers are sacred or confidential):

a. How has the Lord encouraged you to repent and given you
opportunities to do so? What does this teach you about His
character?

b. What can you do to keep from ignoring or hardening your

heart against this encouragement, as the Nephites did in
Mormon 3:3?

Opportunities and invitations from the Lord to make
changes in your life may come more often than you
might realize. For example, they may come when you
partake of the sacrament or when you feel a prompting
from the Holy Ghost to improve yourself or to serve
others. As you look for those opportunities and
respond by making changes promptly, you will invite
the Lord’s redeeming power into your life. To help
you understand the Nephites’ resistance to the Lord’s
attempts to reach them, read Mormon 3:9-10 and
look for how they acted in response to their multiple
victories over the Lamanites. (As you read, it might be
helpful to know that the word avenge in verse 9 means
to get revenge for an injury.)

How did the Nephites respond following their victories
over the Lamanites? Read Mormon 3:11-13, and

find Mormon’s response to the army’s oath to seek
vengeance (revenge).

Mormon had been leading the Nephite armies for over
30 years, despite their blatant wickedness. What does
Mormon’s refusal to lead the army at that time teach
us about the seriousness of seeking vengeance?

Read Mormon 3:14-16, and mark phrases that express
what the Lord taught Mormon about revenge (or
seeking vengeance). One truth we learn from these
verses is that the Lord forbids us to seek revenge.

2. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. Have you ever wanted to seek revenge or get back at
someone for something that person did to you? Why do you
think this is a dangerous or poor response? Who do you think
would be most harmed by your seeking revenge?

b. Why should we leave judgment and vengeance in the Lord's
hands instead of taking it upon ourselves?

Although we may know we should lay aside feelings

of vengeance and have the desire to do so, it can often
be challenging to overcome these feelings when they
arise. As you read the following counsel from President
James E. Faust of the First Presidency, underline phrases
that help you know what you can do to overcome
feelings of vengeance when you encounter them:

“We need to recognize and acknowledge
angry feelings. It will take humility to

do this, but if we will get on our knees
and ask Heavenly Father for a feeling of
forgiveness, He will help us. The Lord
requires us ‘to forgive all men’ [D&C
64:10] for our own good because ‘hatred retards
spiritual growth’ [Orson F. Whitney, Gospel Themes

(1914), 144]. Only as we rid ourselves of hatred and
bitterness can the Lord put comfort into our hearts... .

“.,, When tragedy strikes, we should not respond by
seeking personal revenge but rather let justice take
its course and then let go. It is not easy to let go and
empty our hearts of festering resentment. The Savior
has offered to all of us a precious peace through

His Atonement, but this can come only as we are
willing to cast out negative feelings of anger, spite, or
revenge. For all of us who forgive ‘those who trespass
against us’ [Joseph Smith Translation, Matthew 6:13],
even those who have committed serious crimes, the
Atonement brings a measure of peace and comfort”
(“The Healing Power of Forgiveness,” Ensign or
Liahona, May 2007, 69).

Ponder how you might apply this counsel to let go of
any grudges, anger, or unkind feelings that you may
have toward others.

After refusing to lead the Nephite armies, Mormon
turned his attention to writing for those who would
read his words in the last days. He wanted each

of us to repent and prepare to “stand before the
judgment-seat of Christ” (see Mormon 3:18-22).

Read Mormon 4:1-2, and look for what happened to
the Nephite army as they sought revenge upon the
Lamanites. Read Mormon 4:4, and look for why the
Nephite armies did not prevail (win). Read Mormon
4:5, and identify any truths about the results of
persisting in wickedness. What did you find?

One of the truths you may have seen is that the
judgments of God will overtake the wicked. Often
“it is by the wicked that the wicked are punished”
(Mormon 4:5). The wicked reject God’s help and refuse
to seek His divine protection. Read Mormon 4:11—

14, 18, and look for how the judgments of God were
poured out on the Nephites.

3. In your scripture study journal, answer the following
questions:

a. In your opinion, what is the saddest part of the Nephite
situation in Mormon 3-4?

b. How might the doctrines or truths you have studied so far
today be related to each other? (Consider the relationship
between repentance, revenge, and the judgments of God.)

Ponder what the Lord would have you do to apply
these truths.

285
Mormon 5-6

Mormon decides to again lead the Nephite army, but the
Lamanites prevail; Mormon mourns the destruction of his
people

Is there a difference between the sorrow that might
accompany the death of someone who has been living

a righteous life and someone who died living wickedly?
What do you think the difference is?

After more than 13 years of refusing to lead the
Nephite armies, Mormon again took command.
However, he led them without hope because the
people refused to repent and call on the Lord for His
help. After repelling a few waves of Lamanite attacks,
the Nephites fled. Those who could not flee quickly
enough were destroyed. Mormon wrote a letter to the
king of the Lamanites requesting that he allow time
for the Nephites to gather for one final battle (see
Mormon 5:1-7; 6:1-6).

Read Mormon 6:7-11, and try to understand Mormon’s
sorrow as he witnessed the destruction of his people.
Why do you think death can be fearful to those who
are living wickedly?

4. Read Mormon 6:16-22, and answer the following
questions in your scripture study journal:

a. Why do prophets, leaders, and parents so diligently
encourage us to repent?

b. How does hope of the Lord’s embrace help you to repent?
(see Mormon 6:17).

Ponder whether there is anything the Lord wants you
to repent of right now in your life. You may want to
write about this in your personal journal and set goals
to accomplish it.

5. Write the following at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture study journal:

Additional questions, thoughts, and insights | would like to share
with my teacher:

286

Mormon 7/:1—8:11

Introduction

After the final battle between the Nephites and
Lamanites, Mormon wrote to the future descendants
of the Book of Mormon people about the importance
of knowing who they are and what they must do to
be saved. With great love for the future descendants
of his enemies, Mormon taught the importance of
following the gospel of Jesus Christ, that it might “be
well with you in the day of judgment” (Mormon 7:10).
After Mormon died, Moroni was left alone to write
about the destruction of his people.

Mormon 7

In Mormon’s final testimony, he exhorts the remnant of the
Lamanites to believe in Jesus Christ and follow His gospel

In Mormon 6 you learned that there were 230,000
Nephite casualties in the final battle with the
Lamanites. Imagine that you survived a great battle
like this, but your friends and family did not. How
would you feel about the descendants of the people
who killed your loved ones and conquered your
nation? Read Mormon 7:1-4, and look for what
Mormon wrote to the descendants of the Lamanites.

1. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. What did Mormon want the Lamanites and their descendants
to know?

b. How does this compare with how you thought you might feel
about the descendants of the people who had killed your friends
and family in the imagined situation?

c. What attribute of the Savior do you see in Mormon’s
response to his enemies?

Mormon continued to write to the descendants of
the Lamanites. Read Mormon 7:5-7, and mark at least
three truths Mormon exhorted the descendants of the
Lamanites to believe about the Savior, Jesus Christ.
2. Select one of the truths about Jesus Christ that you
identified, and write in your scripture study journal how
believing that doctrine has affected your life.

Mormon might have felt justified in writing words

of condemnation to the Lamanites who had killed

so many of his people, but because of his knowledge
of the truth, he wrote to teach them what they (and
we) must do to become guiltless before God at the
judgment bar. Read Mormon 7:8-10, and identify what
Mormon testified a person must do. You may want to
mark what you identify in your scriptures.

These verses teach that the Lord offers salvation to all
and will redeem those who accept the principles and
ordinances of His gospel. You may want to write this
principle in your scriptures. Notice that Mormon taught
that the way we come to know how to live this principle
is through our study of the scriptures (see Mormon 7:8).
It may be helpful to understand that the phrase “this
record” refers to the Book of Mormon, and “the record
which shall come unto the Gentiles from the Jews” refers
to the Bible. Similarly, “this” in Mormon 7:9 refers to the
Book of Mormon, and “that” refers to the Bible. You may
want to mark these distinctions in your scriptures.

_

As you conclude Mormon 7, take a moment to
ponder Mormon’s example of charity and Christlike
compassion in writing such a message of hope and
encouragement to the descendants of those who were
his bitter enemies.

3. In your scripture study journal, record your thoughts

about the following question: How can | follow Mormon’s
example and treat others, including those who might mistreat
me, in a way that reflects their eternal worth?

Mormon 8:1-11

Moroni writes of the death of his father the destruction
of his people, and his remaining alone

Think of a time when you were alone. How did you feel
about being alone? Imagine being alone for many years.

Notice the dates in the chapter summaries or at the
bottom of the pages in Mormon 7 and 8. How many
years passed between the time Mormon wrote his last
words in chapter 7 and when Moroni began to write
on the plates in chapter 8?

287
Read Mormon 8:1-2, and look for what happened after
the great battle at Cumorah. Then read Mormon 8:3-9
and mark phrases that describe Moroni’s circumstances
after the destruction of his people. Ponder how you
would feel if you were in similar circumstances.

Think of a time when you felt alone in your beliefs

or standards. Did your determination to follow the
Savior and keep His commandments during that time
increase, stay the same, or decrease? Why?

Look again at Mormon 8:1, 3 to find what Moroni
was resolved to do regardless of his circumstances.
Moroni’s example illustrates that even when you are
alone, you can choose to remain faithful. You may
want to write this truth in your scriptures.

There are others in the Book of Mormon who, like
Moroni, remained faithful even when alone. Abinadi
stood and testified alone before King Noah and his
priests (see Mosiah 12-17). Alma was the lone priest
who believed Abinadi’s words and tried to defend
him (see Mosiah 17:1—4).

Elder Richard G. Scott shared the following story
about a young man who chose to be faithful even
when standing alone:

288

“Consider the example of [this] young
man. Through the years I have watched
how his parents have taught him

from infancy to unwaveringly live the
commandments of God. By example
and precept, they nurtured him, together
with their other children, in truth. They encouraged
the development of discipline and sacrifice to obtain
worthy goals. This young man chose swimming to
instill in his character those qualities. Early-morning
practice sessions required discipline and sacrifice.
Over time he excelled in that sport.

“Then came the challenges—for example, a
championship swim meet on Sunday. Would he
participate? Would he rationalize an exception to his
rule of not swimming on Sunday to help his team win
the championship? No, he would not yield, even under
intense peer pressure. He was called names, even
physically abused. But he would not yield. The rejection
of friends, the loneliness, and the pressure brought
times of sadness and tears. But he would not yield. He
was learning firsthand what each of us must come to
know, the reality of Paul’s counsel to Timothy, ‘All that
will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution’
(2 Tim. 3:12). Over the years this consistent pattern

of righteous living—woven from hundreds of correct
decisions, some in the face of great challenge—has
developed a character of strength and capacity. Now,
as a missionary, he is appreciated by his peers for his
ability to work, his knowledge of truth, his unwavering
devotion, and his determination to share the gospel.
One who earlier was rejected by his peers now has
become a respected leader of his peers” (“First Things
First,” Ensign, May 2001, 8).

Read Mormon 8:10-11, and identify one way the Lord
sustained Moroni and Mormon (before his death)
during the difficult circumstances they faced. The
following encouragement by President Thomas S.
Monson can help you in your resolve to stay faithful
even when you are alone:

“As we go about living from day to day,

it is almost inevitable that our faith will

be challenged. We may at times find

ourselves surrounded by others and yet

2 standing in the minority or even standing

alone concerning what is acceptable and
what is not. Do we have the moral courage to stand
firm for our beliefs, even if by so doing we must stand
alone? ...

“... May we ever be courageous and prepared to stand
for what we believe, and if we must stand alone in the
process, may we do so courageously, strengthened by
the knowledge that in reality we are never alone when
we stand with our Father in Heaven” (“Dare to Stand
Alone,” Ensign and Liahona, Nov. 2011, 60, 67).

4. In your scripture study journal, write answers to the
following questions:

Mormon 8:12—41

Introduction

After writing about the destruction of his people

and the death of his father, Moroni prophesied of the
coming forth of the Book of Mormon and warned those
who would condemn it. Moroni saw that the Nephite
record would come forth in a day of great wickedness,
when many would love worldly possessions more than
God. He testified that the Book of Mormon would be
“of great worth” (Mormon 8:14) during the spiritually
dangerous conditions of the last days.

Mormon 8:12-32

Moroni prophesies of the coming forth of the Book of
Mormon

Write what you believe are some of the greatest gifts
you have ever been given:

Take a moment to think about why these gifts have
been a blessing to you.

Read the following statement from President Ezra Taft
Benson: “I would like to speak about one of the most
significant gifts given to the world in modern times.
The gift I am thinking of is more important than any of
the inventions that have come out of the industrial and
technological revolutions. This is a gift of greater value
to mankind than even the many wonderful advances

we have seen in modern medicine. It is of greater
worth to mankind than the development of flight or
space travel. I speak of the gift of

What do you think the gift President Benson referred
to might be?

Moroni taught about this gift in Mormon 8. Read
Mormon 8:12-14 to find out what the gift is. The
phrase “this record” refers to the Book of Mormon.
The Book of Mormon is the gift that President Benson
spoke of (see “The Book of Mormon—Keystone of
our Religion,” Ensign, Nov. 1986, 4). Write the Book of
Mormon in the blank at the end of President Benson’s

statement.

Look again at Mormon 8:12-14 to identify what Moroni
taught about the value of the Book of Mormon. What
did he teach about the financial value of the plates?
Moroni explained that while the Lord would not allow
the plates to be used for financial gain, the writings
upon the plates are of great worth.

The manner in which the Book of Mormon came
forth can help us understand the importance of this
book. Read Mormon 8:15-16, and identify what
Moroni taught about how the Book of Mormon
would come forth.

1. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. What do you think it means that the Book of Mormon could
be brought forth only by someone who had “an eye single to
[God's] glory”? (Mormon 8:15).

b. What does it mean to you that the Book of Mormon would
be brought forth “by the power of God”? (Mormon 8:16). How
do you feel about the Book of Mormon when you read Moroni’s
words in Mormon 8:16?

289
Moroni warned those who would condemn or oppose
the Book of Mormon. Look for his warnings as you read
Mormon 8:17-22. Why is it important for you to know
that “the eternal purposes of the Lord shall roll on, until
all his promises shall be fulfilled”? (Mormon 8:22).

Moroni explained that the Lord had made a covenant
with the “saints who have gone before me” (Mormon
8:23)—including prophets such as Nephi, Jacob, Enos,
and Alma. The Lord had covenanted that He would
bring forth these prophets’ words in the latter days.
As you study Mormon 8:23-25, identify whom these
prophets prayed for.

These prophets prayed for “their brethren” (Mormon
8:24), meaning the Lamanites and their descendants.
They also prayed for the person who would “bring
these things forth” in the latter days (Mormon 8:25; see
also Mormon 8:16), meaning the Prophet Joseph Smith,
who was chosen to bring forth the Book of Mormon to
the world in these latter days (6ee D&C 3:5-10). Many
of the ancient prophets were aware of Joseph Smith
and prayed for his success to translate and publish the
Book of Mormon, thus fulfilling the purposes of God
(see Mormon 8:22, 24-25; D&C 10:46).

President Boyd K. Packer, President of the Quorum
of the Twelve Apostles, spoke of the role that Joseph
Smith played in bringing forth the Book of Mormon:

“To assume that [Joseph Smith] produced
[the Book of Mormon] without help and
without inspiration is preposterous.

“The truth is, simply, that he was a
prophet of God—nothing more and
not one whit less!

“The scriptures did not come so much from Joseph
Smith as they did through him. He was a conduit
through which the revelations were given. He was
otherwise an ordinary man, as were the prophets in
ancient times and as are the prophets in our day. ...

“The Prophet Joseph Smith was an unschooled farm
boy. To read some of his early letters in the original
shows him to be somewhat unpolished in spelling
and grammar and in expression.

“That the revelations came through him in any form
of literary refinement is nothing short of a miracle”
(“We Believe All That God Has Revealed,” Ensign,
May 1974, 94).

290

Imagine that you are Moroni, who lived approximately
1,600 years ago and through the power of God was
allowed to see our day. Read Mormon 8:35, and consider
what you might think of the spiritual conditions of

our day. Then read Mormon 8:26-32, which contains
Moroni’s prophetic description of the time when the
Book of Mormon would come forth—our day.

2. In your scripture study journal, write two or more of

Moroni's descriptions of our day. Also write why you find
these particular descriptions interesting and applicable to our
day.

Concerning the Book of Mormon, President Ezra Taft
Benson taught:

“We must make the Book of Mormon

a center focus of study [because] it was

| written for our day. The Nephites never
had the book; neither did the Lamanites
of ancient times. It was meant for us... .

“Each of the major writers of the
Book of Mormon testified that he wrote for future
generations. ...

“Tf they saw our day, and chose those things which
would be of greatest worth to us, is not that how

we should study the Book of Mormon? We should
constantly ask ourselves, ‘Why did the Lord inspire
Mormon (or Moroni or Alma) to include that in his
record? What lesson can I learn from that to help me
live in this day and age?’” (“The Book of Mormon—
Keystone of Our Religion,” 6).

3. To ponder the value of the Book of Mormon for you
personally, answer the following questions in your
scripture study journal:

a. Think about how accurate Moroni’s prophecies are about
the conditions of our day (see Mormon 8:26—32). What do
these prophecies teach you about the value of the Book of
Mormon for our day?

b. Why do you think the Book of Mormon is, as President Ezra
Taft Benson taught, “one of the most significant gifts given to
the world in modern times”? (” The Book of Mormon—Keystone
of our Religion,” 4).

c. If a friend asked you why the Book of Mormon was important
to you, how would you respond?
Mormon 8:33-41

Moroni sees the last days and condemns the spiritual
wickedness of our time

Think of a time when you noticed someone in need—
someone with a temporal, emotional, social, or spiritual
need. Consider what you did or could have done to
help that person. Ponder why you chose to help or not
help that person. Why do you think people sometimes
don’t help those in need?

Read Mormon 8:36—41, and look for the reasons
Moroni gave for why some people in the last days
will not help those in need. Consider marking
these reasons in your scriptures. It may be helpful
to understand that the word adorn means “make
beautiful” or “decorate.”

What are some examples of how youth today might
love the things money can buy and following worldly
pursuits more than being a true disciple of Jesus Christ?
Study Mormon 8:38, 41, and identify the consequences
people will face for their pride, wickedness, and neglect
of the poor and the needy.

4. Write a principle in your scripture study journal that
summarizes what you have learned from Mormon 8:36—41.

One example of a principle taught in these verses is:
God will hold us accountable for how we treat the
poor and those in need.

5. Answer the following question in your scripture study

journal: What are some of the most common needs—
temporal, social, emotional, and spiritual—among youth in your
school or community? Then think of something you can do in the
next week to care for someone in need. Write this goal in your
scripture study journal.

you learn can help you act in
faith, learn more from your
study, and progress spiritually.
Seek the guidance of the Holy
Ghost as you set goals. Make
sure your goals require effort
but are also realistic and
achievable. Write specifically
what you will do, when you
plan to do it, and how you
plan to do it.

Mormon 9

Introduction

Moroni finished his father’s record by calling upon
those who do not believe in Jesus Christ to turn to
God through repentance. He taught that God is a God
of miracles who does not change. He also taught that
miracles cease only when people stop having faith. He
encouraged all mankind to pray to the Father in the
name of Jesus Christ to receive those things they need.

Mormon 9:1-6

Moroni calls upon those who do not believe in Jesus Christ
to repent

Imagine what you might think and feel if you were to
enter into God’s presence today. How do you think
wicked people would feel in His presence? Read
Mormon 9:1-5, and notice that Moroni described what
will eventually happen when people who choose not
to believe in Jesus Christ are finally brought into God’s
presence.

President Joseph Fielding Smith explained that
many people mistakenly believe that they will feel
comfortable in God’s presence even if they have not
repented of their sins:

“There can be no salvation without
repentance. A man cannot enter into the
kingdom of God in his sins. It would be a
very inconsistent thing for a man to come
into the presence of the Father and to
dwell in God’s presence in his sins... .

“T think there are a great many people upon the
earth, many of them perhaps in the Church—at least
some in the Church—who have an idea they can go
through this life doing as they please, violating the
commandments of the Lord, and yet eventually they
are going to come into his presence. They think they
are going to repent, perhaps in the spirit world.

“They ought to read these words of Moroni: ‘Do ye
suppose that ye shall dwell with him [Christ] under
a consciousness of your guilt? Do ye suppose that ye
could be happy to dwell with that holy Being, when
your souls are racked with a consciousness of guilt
that ye have ever abused his laws?

“Behold I say unto you that ye would be more
miserable to dwell with a holy and just God, under
a consciousness of your filthiness before him, than

291
ye would to dwell with the damned souls in hell. For
behold, when ye shall be brought to see your nakedness
before God, and also the glory of God, and the holiness
of Jesus Christ, it will kindle a flame of unquenchable
fire upon you’ [Mormon 9:3-5]” (Doctrines of Salvation,
comp. Bruce R. McConkie, 3 vols. [1954-56], 2:195-96).

1. Answer the following question in your scripture study

journal: Why do you think it is wrong to wait to repent in
this life, believing you can repent in the next life? (You may want
to use what you learn from Mormon 9:1—5; Alma 12:14; and
Alma 34:32-34 in your answer.)

Read Mormon 9:6, and look for what the
“unbelieving” must do to avoid the anguish Moroni
described. Consider marking the words in Mormon 9:6
that describe the condition of people who turn to God
and ask Him for forgiveness. From this verse we learn:
If we will repent and call upon God, we will be
spotless when we come into His presence. You may
want to write this principle in your scriptures or your
scripture study journal.

2. In your scripture study journal, write a few sentences

about how you imagine you would feel in God's presence
if you knew you had been made pure and spotless through the
Savior's Atonement.

Through repentance and righteous living, you can
prepare to be comfortable in God’s presence. Ponder
the most important thing you feel you could do now
to be prepared to meet God.

Mormon 9:7-20

Moroni declares that God performs miracles and answers
the prayers of the faithful

Have you ever witnessed or experienced a miracle?
Write your definition of the word miracle:

Look up the word miracle in the Bible Dictionary or
the Guide to the Scriptures to clarify or add to your
definition. Why do you think some people today do
not believe in miracles?

As recorded in Mormon 9:7-8, Moroni wrote to people
in the last days who would deny that God lives, that He
gives revelations, and that He pours out gifts upon the
faithful. Moroni taught powerfully that there is a God
and that He is the same “yesterday, today, and forever”
(Mormon 9:9). He continues to work miracles among
faithful people in all ages. Read Mormon 9:9-11, 15-19,
and identify what Moroni taught about God’s nature

292

so that he could help people believe that God still
works miracles.

3. In your scripture study journal, write what you

learned from Mormon 9:9-11, 15-19 about God's nature.
Also write your answer to this question: What do these verses
teach you about God's willingness and ability to perform miracles
in the lives of people today?

Read Mormon 9:20, and look for reasons why some
people may not experience miracles.

Moroni’s words recorded in Mormon 9:9-19 teach this
principle: Because God is unchangeable, He will
provide miracles according to His children’s faith.
You may want to write this principle next to Mormon
9:19-20 in your scriptures.

We can experience God’s miraculous power in many
ways in our lives. After reviewing some of the great
miracles described in the scriptures, Sister Sydney S.
Reynolds, who served in the Primary general
presidency, taught:

“Just as important as these ‘mighty miracles’ are the
smaller ‘private miracles’ that teach each of us to have
faith in the Lord. These come as we recognize and
heed the promptings of the Spirit in our lives. ...
“T believe that all of us can bear witness to these
small miracles. We know children who pray for help
to find a lost item and find it. We know of young
people who gather the courage to stand as a witness
of God and feel His sustaining hand. We know friends
who pay their tithing with the last of their money and
then, through a miracle, find themselves able to pay
their tuition or their rent or somehow obtain food

for their family. We can share experiences of prayers
answered and priesthood blessings that gave courage,
brought comfort, or restored health. These daily
miracles acquaint us with the hand of the Lord in our
lives” (“A God of Miracles,” Ensign, May 2001, 12).

4. Write in your scripture study journal about an
experience you have had or one that you know of that
confirms God is still a God of miracles today.

Mormon 9:21-37

Moroni teaches about prayer and about the purpose of the
Nephite record

Can you recall a time when you felt that Heavenly
Father gave you the help you needed because you had
prayed? Read Mormon 9:21, and look for what Moroni
taught about praying to Heavenly Father for help.

Read the following statement, and look for what it
means to pray in the name of Christ: “We pray in
Christ’s name when our mind is the mind of Christ,
and our wishes the wishes of Christ—when his
words abide in us (John 15:7). We then ask for things
it is possible for God to grant. Many prayers remain
unanswered because they are not in Christ’s name at
all; they in no way represent his mind, but spring out
of the selfishness of man’s heart” (Bible Dictionary,
“Prayer”).

Consider your own prayers based on what you just
read. What can you do to more fully pray in the name
of Jesus Christ?

To provide an example of people who believed in the
Savior and were able to work miracles, Moroni quoted
what Jesus Christ taught His Nephite disciples. As
recorded in Mormon 9:22-25, the Savior commanded
His disciples to go into all the world and preach the
gospel, and He promised that miraculous “signs shall
follow them that believe” (Mormon 9:24). Moroni then
continued his teachings about prayer.

5. Read Mormon 9:27-29, and identify what Moroni

taught about how we should pray in faith. Write the
things you identify in your scripture study journal. Then write a
few sentences describing how you can use one of these
teachings to improve your own prayers.

You might want to write the following principle in your
scriptures near Mormon 9:27: If we pray in faith to
Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ, He
will grant us blessings that will help us work out
our salvation.

As Moroni concluded his words, he expressed concern
that some people in the last days would reject the Book
of Mormon because of the imperfections of those who
wrote it (see Mormon 9:30-34). Read Mormon 9:35-37,
and look for what Moroni declared about the purposes
of the Book of Mormon.

Consider how the coming forth of the Book of Mormon
is additional evidence that God is a God of miracles and
that He answers prayers.

INTRODUCTION TO

Ether

Why Study This Book?

As you study the book of Ether, you will learn about
the Jaredites—a group of people who traveled to
the Western Hemisphere and lived there for many
centuries before the arrival of the people of Lehi.
This book will help you learn important principles
concerning prayer, revelation, and the relationship
between exercising faith in Jesus Christ and receiving
spiritual knowledge. It will also help you understand
the role of prophets in persuading people to repent
and the consequences that come to those who reject
Jesus Christ and His prophets.

Who Wrote This Book?

Moroni abridged this book from 24 gold plates called
the plates of Ether. It is named for the prophet Ether,
who was the last prophet of the Jaredites and created a
record of their history (see Ether 15:33-34). In the days
of King Mosiah, some of the people of Limhi discovered
the plates of Ether as they were searching for the land
of Zarahemla (see Mosiah 8:7-11; Ether 1:2). Nephite
prophets and record keepers passed the plates of Ether
down until they came into Moroni’s possession. Moroni
stated that he did not include “the hundredth part” of
the record in his abridgment (Ether 15:33).

When and Where Was It Written?

The original sources used to create the book of

Ether were written centuries before Moroni made his
abridgment. The first Jaredite record was created when
the brother of Jared wrote the vision he received before
his people crossed the seas (see Ether 4:1). No other
record keepers among the Jaredites are mentioned until
Ether (see Ether 13:3; 15:33). Moroni abridged the book
of Ether (see Mormon 8:3-6; Moroni 10:1). Moroni did
not state where he was when he made the abridgment,
although he wrote that the Jaredites were destroyed in
“this north country” (Ether 1:1), indicating he may have
been in the land where they were destroyed.

294

Ether 1-2

Introduction

The book of Ether is Moroni’s abridgment of the
history of the Jaredites. The Jaredites were people who
came to the Western Hemisphere centuries before the
people of Lehi. Following the Flood in Noah’s day,
many descendants of those who had been spared
became wicked. One group of people attempted to
build a tower “whose top may reach unto heaven”
(Genesis 11:4). The account of the Jaredite nation
began with the building of the Tower of Babel. The
Lord dealt with the widespread wickedness by
confounding the common language and by scattering
the people across the face of the earth (see Genesis
11:5-8; Ether 1:33). This account in the book of Ether
begins with Jared and his brother seeking the Lord’s
help when He confounded the language of the people
at the Tower of Babel. The Lord preserved the language
of Jared, his brother, and their families and friends and
led them through the wilderness toward the promised
land. The Lord then instructed the brother of Jared to
build eight barges to carry his people over the seas.

Ether 1:1-33

Moroni records the genealogy of Ether back to Jared at the
Tower of Babel

To help you understand where the book of Ether came
from, review “Overview of Mosiah 7-24” from the
Unit 12: Day 1 lesson (page 116). Refer to journey 4,
and notice what Limhi’s people found on this journey.
Look at the beginning of the book of Ether, and find
the brief description of the book under the title. This
description explains that the record of the Jaredites was
taken from 24 gold plates found by the people of Limhi.

After Moroni finished the record of his father, he took
the Jaredites’ record and created a shorter version of it
to include in the Book of Mormon. Read Ether 1:1-4,
and look for what Moroni said he did not include in his
version of the Jaredite record. Then read Ether 1:5, and
look for what part of the account Moroni did include
in his record. The tower referred to in Ether 1:5 is the
Tower of Babel. As explained in Ether 1:33, the Lord
“confounded” (confused or mixed up) the language
of the people who sought to build the tower so they
could not understand each other, and He scattered
the people throughout the earth.

As recorded in Ether 1:6-33, a man named Ether
had written the Jaredite record. Moroni recorded the
ancestry of Ether back to a man named Jared, who
lived during the time of the Tower of Babel.

Ether 1:33-43

The brother of Jared prays for help, and his family members
and friends receive mercy and guidance

Have you ever been in a country or area where
people spoke a language you did not understand?
How do you think you would feel if you could not
understand the language that others around you
were speaking? If you could pick only a few people
to communicate with in that situation, whom would
you choose? This situation existed for a man named
Jared and his brother, as well as their families, who
lived during the time of the Tower of Babel. Read
Ether 1:33-37, and look for the people with whom
Jared wanted to be able to communicate. After the
brother of Jared obtained a promise from the Lord
that their language would not be confounded (see
Ether 1:34-35), he prayed for his friends (see Ether
1:36-37). As demonstrated by the brother of Jared,
one of the characteristics of faithful people is to pray
for their friends to receive the Lord’s blessings.

The Lord blessed the families of Jared and his brother
and their friends so that their language was not
confounded. Then Jared asked his brother to pray to
God, asking Him where their families should go. (See
Ether 1:38—40.)

Read Ether 1:40—43, and identify the instructions the
Lord gave to the Jaredites to guide them in their journey.
Why do you think it was important for Jared and his
brother to follow these instructions from the Lord?

Ether 2:1-12

The Jaredites begin their journey toward the promised land

Read Ether 2:1—3 to discover how well the Jaredites
responded to the instructions the Lord gave them
about preparing to travel to a promised land (see
Ether 1:41—42). Then read Ether 2:4—6, and look

for what happened next. Notice that because the
Jaredites had obeyed the Lord’s instructions, He gave
them further directions. Ponder the blessings and the
guidance the Jaredites received because they followed
the Lord’s instructions.

From the Jaredites’ experience we learn this principle:
As we act in faith on direction the Lord has given
us, we can receive further guidance from Him. You
may want to write this principle in your scriptures next
to Ether 2:6.

Can you think of an impression or prompting you
have received from the Lord while praying, studying
the scriptures, or attending a Church meeting? Keep
that impression or prompting in mind as you read the
following statement from Elder Richard G. Scott of the
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles about how we often
receive answers to prayers: “Seldom will you receive a
complete response [to prayer] all at once. It will come
a piece at a time, in packets, so that you will grow in
capacity. As each piece is followed in faith, you will be
led to other portions until you have the whole answer.
That pattern requires you to exercise faith in our
Father’s capacity to respond. While sometimes it’s very
hard, it results in significant personal growth” (“Using
the Supernal Gift of Prayer,” Ensign or Liahona, May
2007, 9).

1. Write in your scripture study journal how you

responded (or can respond) to the spiritual prompting
you thought of earlier. You might also include the blessings you
received (or can receive) from acting on that prompting.

As recorded in Ether 2:7-12, the Lord told the brother
of Jared that when he and his people arrived in the
promised land, they would need to “serve him, the true
and only God, or they should be swept off” (Ether 2:8).

295
Ether 2:13-15

The Lord chastens the brother of Jared for not calling upon
Him in prayer

Read Ether 2:13-15, and look for what happened when
the Jaredites came to the great sea that divided the
lands. They had been guided through the wilderness
by the Lord because they listened to the Lord and kept
His commandments. However, after they had camped
by the great sea for four years, the Lord came to the
brother of Jared and chastised him for failing to pray.

Ether 2:14—15 helps us learn these principles: The
Lord is not pleased when we fail to call upon
Him in prayer. The Lord desires us to call upon
Him regularly in prayer.

As you read the following statement from Elder
Donald L. Staheli, who served as a member of the
Seventy, think about how often you pray: “Daily
fervent prayers seeking forgiveness and special
help and direction are essential to our lives and
the nourishment of our testimonies. When we
become hurried, repetitive, casual, or forgetful in our
prayers, we tend to lose the closeness of the Spirit,
which is so essential in the continual direction we
need to successfully manage the challenges of our
everyday lives” (“Securing Our Testimonies” Ensign
or Liahona, Nov. 2004, 39).

In your personal journal or on a separate piece of
paper, respond to the following questions:

¢ How do you feel about the frequency of your
personal prayers?

e How do you feel about the sincerity of your personal
prayers?

e In your personal prayers, do you feel that you truly
communicate with Heavenly Father? Why, or why
not?

e If you could make one change that would improve
your personal prayers, what might it be?

As recorded in Ether 2:16, the brother of Jared repented
of his sins and prayed to the Lord for his family
members and friends. The Lord told him that he was
forgiven but that he must continue in righteousness in
order to be led to the promised land.

Ether 2:16-25

The Jaredites build barges to cross the ocean to the
promised land

Think of an important personal decision you are facing
or might face in the future, such as how to deal with

296

a difficult family or social situation, how to do well in
school, whom to marry, or what profession to pursue.
Have you thought about how the Lord might give
you direction or help in that situation? As you study
the remainder of Ether 2, ponder the decision you
identified and look for principles that will help you
receive the Lord’s assistance.

Read Ether 2:16-17, and look for what the Lord asked
the Jaredites to do to progress toward the promised
land. The brother of Jared faced three problems
resulting from the design of the barges. Read Ether
2:18-19, and mark the three problems the brother of
Jared mentioned to the Lord.

What the Lord did and what He required Jared’s
brother to do were different for each problem. From
each problem and solution, we can learn a different
truth about how the Lord assists us when we need
help. Compare the solutions you wrote in the chart
with those in the following list:

No air (Ether 2:20-21). To solve this problem, the
Lord told the brother of Jared what he should do. The
brother of Jared then had the faith to follow the Lord’s
instructions.

No steering (Ether 6:4—9). To solve this problem, the
Lord provided the answer to the problem Himself.

No light (Ether 2:22—3:6). To solve this problem, the
Lord gave the brother of Jared some direction. The
brother of Jared then had to think of a solution to the
problem—based on the information he had—and ask
for the Lord’s approval and help in carrying it out.

From the brother of Jared’s experience, we learn this
principle: As we strive to do our part to solve our
problems, we can receive the Lord’s help. Thinking
about the personal decision you thought of earlier,
how can knowing this principle help you receive help
or guidance concerning this decision? What do you
think the Lord might expect you to do in making your
decision?

Ether 3

Introduction

The Lord asked the brother of Jared, “What will

ye that I should do that ye may have light in your
vessels?” (Ether 2:23). In response, the brother of
Jared carefully prepared 16 stones and humbly prayed
that the Lord would touch them “that they may shine
forth in darkness” (Ether 3:4). Because of the brother
of Jared’s great faith, he saw the Savior’s finger as the
Savior touched the stones. The Lord then showed
Himself to the brother of Jared and commanded him
to write what he had seen and heard.

Ether 3:1-20
The Lord touches stones to provide light for the Jaredite
barges, and He shows Himself to the brother of Jared

What are some examples of what you or other young
people sincerely pray for? Choose one of these things,
and write it here:

As you study the example of the brother of Jared in
Ether 3, look for insights that would help you or a
friend receive help from the Lord.

Think about the brother of Jared’s prayer to the Lord
about providing light for the barges and the Lord’s
answer to him. Review Ether 2:22-3:1. Then write a
caption for each of the following pictures that describes
what the brother of Jared did as his part to solve the
problem of not having light.

297
1. Write in your scripture study journal about what

impresses you about the brother of Jared's efforts to solve
the problem of having light in the barges. Even though the
brother of Jared went to great effort, consider how effective his
molten stones would have been at providing light without the
Lord's help.

Read Ether 3:2—5, and then do the following:

e Identify or mark phrases that show the brother of
Jared was humble and recognized his dependence on
God. It may be helpful to know that the phrase “our
natures have become evil continually” refers to our
sinful state on earth. Because of the Fall of Adam, we
are physically separated from God. We are also prone
to sin. Without divine help, we could never return to
God's presence.

e Identify what the brother of Jared asked the Lord to
do.

e Identify or mark what the brother of Jared testified
he knew about God.

2. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:
a. What evidence can you find in Ether 3:1—-5 that the brother
of Jared had faith that the Lord could help Him solve His
problem?
b. How can his example help you to recognize your
dependence on the Lord as you ask for His help?

Read the following statement from Elder Jeffrey R.
Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles,
which emphasizes the faith of the brother of Jared:
“Surely God, as well as the reader, feels something
very striking in the childlike innocence and fervor
of this man’s faith. ‘Behold, O Lord, thou canst do this’

298

[Ether 3:5]. Perhaps there is no more powerful, single
line of faith spoken by man in scripture. . .. However
uncertain the prophet is about his own ability, he has
no uncertainty about God’s power” (“Rending the
Veil of Unbelief,” in Nurturing Faith through the Book of
Mormon: The 24th Annual Sidney B. Sperry Symposium
[1995], 12).

Read Ether 3:6, and imagine what it might have been
like to be in the situation described in this verse.

Read Ether 3:9, looking for why the Lord was willing to
touch the stones and why the brother of Jared was able
to see the finger of the Lord.

Finish the following principle statement according
to what you have learned so far in Ether 3: As we
humbly call upon the Lord, He will answer us
according to our and His will.

3. Answer one or both of the following questions in your
scripture study journal:

a. Refer to what you wrote at the beginning of this lesson
about what you or other young people pray for. How might
someone show faith in the Lord as he or she seeks for the Lord’s
help and guidance in that situation?

b. What have you experienced in your life that has led you to
know of the truthfulness of the principle that as we humbly call
upon the Lord, He will answer us according to our faith and His
will?

Take a moment and silently evaluate how much you
trust the Lord. Read Ether 3:9-12, and look for and
mark evidence of the faith the brother of Jared had in
the Lord.

Review Ether 3:11, and think about whether you
have enough faith in the Lord to commit to believe
and follow what He will reveal to you even before He
reveals it.

Read the following statement from Elder
Jeffrey R. Holland, and underline what
we must do to exercise faith like the
brother of Jared: “Preparatory faith is
formed by experiences in the past—by
the known, which provides a basis for
belief. But redemptive faith must often be exercised
toward experiences in the future—the unknown,
which provides an opportunity for the miraculous.
... Faith like that of the brother of Jared, precedes

the miracle and the knowledge. He had to believe
before God spoke. He had to act before the ability

to complete that action was apparent. He had to
commit to the complete experience in advance of
even the first segment of its realization. Faith is to
agree unconditionally—and in advance—to whatever
conditions God may require in both the near and
distant future” (Christ and the New Covenant: The
Messianic Message of the Book of Mormon [1997], 18-19).

Think about the experiences of the brother of Jared,
beginning at the Tower of Babel. What experiences may
have helped increase his faith in the Lord? How do you
think these experiences prepared him to exercise “such
exceeding faith” (Ether 3:9) at that moment?

4. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. What is an experience in your life that has increased your
faith in the Lord?

b. How did that experience prepare you to exercise even greater
faith in the future?

Read Ether 3:13-20, and look for the blessing the
brother of Jared received because of his faith. What did
the brother of Jared learn about the Savior from this
remarkable experience? Another important principle
you can learn from Ether 3 is this: As we exercise
faith in the Lord, we will grow closer to Him. You
may want to write this principle in your scriptures next
to Ether 3:11-20.

Elder Jeffrey R. Holland commented on Ether 3:15-16
and the possible confusion that might arise from that
experience:

“TAn] issue that requires brief comment stems from
the Lord’s exclamation ‘Never has man come before
me with such exceeding faith as thou hast; for were
it not so ye could not have seen my finger.’ And later,
‘Never have I showed myself unto man whom I have
created, for never has man believed in me as thou
hast.’ [Ether 3:9, 15.]

“The potential for confusion here comes with the
realization that many (and perhaps all) of the major
prophets living prior to the brother of Jared had
seen God. How, then, do we account for the Lord’s
declaration? . ..

“This issue has been much discussed by Latter-day
Saint writers, and there are several possible
explanations, any one—or all—of which may cast light
upon the larger truth of this passage. Nevertheless,
without additional revelation or commentary on the
matter, any conjecture is only that and as such is
inadequate and incomplete... .

“Some believe that the Lord meant he had never
before revealed himself to man in that degree or to that
extent. This theory suggests that divine appearances to
earlier prophets had not been with the same ‘fulness,’
that never before had the veil been lifted to give such
a complete revelation of Christ’s nature and being. . . .

“A final explanation—and in terms of the brother of
Jared’s faith the most persuasive one—is that Christ
was saying to the brother of Jared, ‘Never have I
showed myself unto man in this manner, without my
volition, driven solely by the faith of the beholder’ Asa
rule, prophets are invited into the presence of the Lord,
are bidden to enter his presence by him and only with
his sanction. The brother of Jared, on the other hand,
seems to have thrust himself through the veil, not as
an unwelcome guest but perhaps technically as an
uninvited one. Said Jehovah, ‘Never has man come
before me with such exceeding faith as thou hast; for
were it not so ye could not have seen my finger... .
Never has man believed in me as thou hast.’ Obviously
the Lord himself was linking unprecedented faith with
this unprecedented vision. If the vision itself was not
unique, then it had to be the faith and how the vision
was obtained that was so unparalleled. The only way
that faith could be so remarkable was its ability to take
the prophet, uninvited, where others had been able

to go only with God’s bidding” (Christ and the New
Covenant, 20-23).

299
Ether 3:21-28

The Lord commands the brother of Jared to write the things
he saw and to seal up his record

Read Ether 3:25—26, and identify what else the Lord
showed the brother of Jared. As recorded in Ether
3:21-24, 27-28, the Lord commanded the brother

of Jared to write the things he was shown in vision
and to seal them up. The Lord also explained that He
would prepare a way for the brother of Jared’s writings
to be translated in the future. One of the ways this
prophecy was fulfilled was when the Prophet Joseph
Smith translated the book of Ether from the gold
plates as part of the Book of Mormon and made the
record of the Jaredites available for all people to read.

Ponder how you can apply what you have learned
today and what you can do to demonstrate your faith
in the Lord. As you exercise faith in Jesus Christ, God
will pour out blessings upon you, as He did the brother
of Jared.

Ether 4—5

Introduction

The Lord commanded Moroni to write and then seal
up his record of the vision of the brother of Jared.
Moroni explained that these writings would be revealed
when men have as much faith as the brother of Jared.
In addition, Moroni prophesied that three witnesses
would bear testimony of the truthfulness of the Book
of Mormon in the latter days.

Ether 4:1-7
Moroni records and seals up the full account of the brother
of Jared's vision

Think of an object that is especially valuable to you or
your family that you might want to keep out of the reach
of small children. What would a child need to learn or
do before you would trust him or her with that object?

300

Similarly, the Lord has valuable truths He wants to
share with us, but He waits until we are ready to
receive them. As you study Ether 4, look for what
Moroni taught that can help you prepare to receive
greater truth and guidance from the Lord.

As you read in Ether 3, the Lord showed the brother
of Jared a vision of all the inhabitants of the earth—
past, present, and future—and all things concerning
the earth. The brother of Jared was then commanded
to write what he had seen and to seal up his writings.
Read Ether 4:4—5, and look for Moroni’s description of
what the brother of Jared was shown. Moroni wrote
about what the brother of Jared saw and was likewise
commanded by the Lord to seal the vision up to come
forth in the Lord’s due time. The vision that these
verses refer to is included in what is commonly called
the sealed portion of the Book of Mormon.

Moroni prophesied of the conditions that need to exist
before the revelation given to the brother of Jared will be
made known. You may want to mark these conditions in
Ether 4:6—7.

1. To help you ponder what it means to “exercise faith in

[the Lord], even as the brother of Jared” (Ether 4:7), review
Ether 1-3 and list in your scripture study journal the ways the
brother of Jared showed faith and trust in the Lord. Also choose
and describe one of these examples that most impressed you and
explain why.

Just as you would trust a child with a valuable object
only under certain conditions, the Lord shares
additional truths with His children only as we
demonstrate our spiritual preparedness, believe in the
precious truths He has already revealed, and exercise
faith in Him.

Ether 4:8-19

Moroni teaches what we must do to receive further
revelation

Look at any window coverings in the room you are in.
Think about how the window coverings limit what you
can see.

Moroni used the symbol of a veil, which is similar to a
window covering, to teach principles that govern how
each of us can receive revelation. Read Ether 4:15, and
find the phrase that includes the word veil. Notice that
Moroni compared unbelief to a veil. In what ways is
unbelief like a veil?

It may be helpful to understand that the word rend in
Ether 4:15 means to tear. Imagine what it would be
GPOPOPOPOPOPOPOHOPOPGHOPOPGPGPOPOPOPOPOPOPOPOPOPOPOPOD>OPOPOPODOPON

like if you could rend the veil between you and the
knowledge of the Lord.

Moroni described those things that help “rend that veil
of unbelief” and allow us to receive further revelation.
He began by warning of an attitude that prevents

us from receiving further revelation. Read Ether 4:8,
and mark what would cause the Lord to hold back
revelation and “show no greater things.”

2. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. What do you think it means to “contend against the word
of the Lord”? (Ether 4:8).

b. What are some ways a young person today might “contend
against the word of the Lord”?

Moroni included the Lord’s own words to describe
how to receive additional revelation from Him. Search
Ether 4:11, 13-15, and mark phrases that teach what
we must do to invite the Lord’s revelation and how
He will respond if we do these things.

What principles concerning revelation and how to
invite it into your life do you learn from these verses?
You may want to write one principle you learn from
these verses in your scriptures next to Ether 4:11.

One important principle we can learn from the Lord’s
counsel is that as we exercise great faith in the word
of the Lord, He will, in His own due time and way,
bless us with further revelation.

3. In your scripture study journal, explain why you think

you need to show faith in the word of God you have
already received before the Lord will reveal more to you. Then
rate yourself on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being “very effective”) on
how well you feel you are exercising faith in the Lord by seeking
for and following His word in each of the following areas:

a. Daily prayer
b. Following promptings you receive through the Holy Ghost

c. Sustaining and following leaders in your branch, ward,
district, or stake

d. Studying the word of God in church or seminary

e. Personal scripture study

f. Following the words of the prophets and living the
commandments

4. \n your scripture study journal, describe how obeying
God in one of the areas mentioned above has enabled
you to receive further revelation from the Lord.

Ponder how you might incorporate this principle of
exercising faith in the word of the Lord in your efforts

to invite additional revelation and guidance from the
Lord.

Ether 5

Moroni declares that three witnesses shall see and bear
testimony of the plates

Read Ether 5:1-3. What did Moroni write in these
verses that is directed to the Prophet Joseph Smith—
the person who would one day translate the record
on the plates? Imagine what it may have been like
for Joseph Smith to encounter these verses as he was
translating the Book of Mormon.

301
Read the following statement from
President Henry B. Eyring of the First
Presidency, and look for a phrase that
impresses you about the testimony of the
Three Witnesses: “The Three Witnesses
never denied their testimony of the Book
of Mormon. They could not because they knew it was
true. They made sacrifices and faced difficulties beyond
what most people ever know. Oliver Cowdery gave the
same testimony about the divine origin of the Book
of Mormon as he lay dying... .That they continued
to affirm what they saw and heard in that marvelous
experience, during long periods of estrangement from
the Church and from Joseph, makes their testimony
more powerful” (“An Enduring Testimony of the
Mission of the Prophet Joseph,” Ensign or Liahona,
Nov. 2003, 90).

According to Ether 5:2-3, what would the Prophet
Joseph Smith be privileged to do with the plates?

5. Just like the three men who were privileged to witness

the reality of the gold plates, you too can be a witness to
the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. In your scripture study
journal, record a few ways you can also be a witness of the Book
of Mormon. In addition, write how your witness of the Book of
Mormon could influence other people.

Prayerfully seek opportunities to share your witness
of the Book of Mormon with someone this week.

Ether 6

Introduction

After preparing according to the commandments
of the Lord, the Jaredites boarded their vessels and
trusted the Lord to take them safely through their
difficult journey to the promised land. The Lord
sent winds that tossed the barges on the waves
and buried them in the sea many times, yet those

302

same winds propelled them toward the promised
land. After establishing themselves in the new land,
the people chose a king despite warnings from the
brother of Jared.

Ether 6:1-12

The Lord drives the Jaredite barges by the wind to the
promised land

There are times when we might feel it is difficult to do
what the Lord asks, such as sharing the gospel with a
friend, staying morally clean, choosing friends with high
standards, and setting correct priorities in life. Can you
think of other examples of when it may be difficult to do
what the Lord asks?

The account of the Jaredites’ journey to the promised
land teaches principles that can guide you when you
find it difficult to do what the Lord commands. Read
Ether 2:24—25, and look for what the Lord warned the
Jaredites would make their journey to the promised
land difficult.

In order to withstand these difficulties, the Lord
commanded the Jaredites to make barges that were
“tight like unto a dish” (Ether 2:17), with holes in the
top and bottom that they could unplug for air. Read
Ether 6:1-4, and identify other ways the Lord had the
Jaredites prepare for the difficulties of the voyage.

It may be helpful to understand that “commending
themselves unto the Lord their God” (Ether 6:4)
means that the Jaredites entrusted themselves to
God for their care and preservation.

1. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. Why might it have been difficult for the Jaredites to trust
in the Lord in this situation?

b. Why do you think both preparing and commending
themselves to the Lord were essential?

As you read Ether 6:5-11, try to imagine what it must
have been like to travel in a Jaredite barge.

2. To help you prepare to identify gospel principles you
can learn from this account, answer the following
questions in your scripture study journal:

a. How did the Jaredites show their trust in the Lord during
their difficult journey? (see Ether 6:7, 9).

b. How did God bless them during their journey?
After nearly a year upon the water, the Jaredites’
journey finally came to an end. Read Ether 6:12,

and identify how they felt when they arrived in the
promised land. Summarize what you have learned in
this lesson so far by completing the following principle
statement: As we trust in the Lord and do His will,
He will

One way of completing this statement is with the
phrase “direct the course of our lives.” To deepen

your understanding of this principle, refer back to the
situations when we might feel it difficult to do what
the Lord asks, listed at the beginning of the lesson. Just
as He did with the Jaredites, the Lord prepares us to
overcome the difficulties we will face in life as we pray,
follow the prophet, and keep the commandments.

3. In your scripture study journal, record how someone

might show trust in the Lord. Based on the Jaredites’
example, what should we do when faced with a difficult
commandment from the Lord?

4. Reflect on the following principle: If we trust in the

Lord, adversity and hardship can help us progress
and attain promised blessings. (You may want to write it in
your scriptures next to Ether 6:5-10.) In your scripture study
journal, answer the following questions:

a. How do you feel you have progressed and attained blessings
by faithfully enduring hardships you have faced or are currently
facing in your life?

b. How might you better trust in the Lord and follow His
directions in difficult situations you may face?

Ether 6:13-18

The Jaredites teach their children to walk humbly before
the Lord

Imagine that you, like the Jaredites, have just crossed
an ocean and arrived in a land completely new to you.
Read Ether 6:13-18, and think about the following
questions: What might be some examples of what it
means to walk humbly before the Lord? How have
your parents and others encouraged you to walk
humbly before the Lord? What do you think is the
relationship between walking humbly and being
taught from on high? When have you felt you were
“taught from on high”? (Ether 6:17).

with my teacher:

Ether 7-11

Introduction

Though the brother of Jared prophesied that
establishing a Jaredite king would lead to captivity, his
words were not immediately fulfilled. The first Jaredite
king, Orihah, ruled in righteousness. However, a man
named Jared became king two generations later by
forming a secret combination. During the reigns of
their kings, the Jaredites went through several cycles
of listening to the prophets and living in righteousness,
and rejecting the prophets and living in wickedness.

Ether 7

Corihor seizes the kingdom from his father, his brother
Shule regains it, and prophets condemn the wickedness
of the people

How do you think someone might feel living in
captivity? Have you ever had similar feelings of being
restrained because of incorrect choices you have made?
Look for insights into how you can avoid physical and
spiritual captivity as you study Ether 7-11.

When Jared and his brother became old, the Jaredites
asked for a king. The brother of Jared warned the
people that having a king would lead to captivity (see

303
Ether 6:19-23). Prophets have always prophesied
against actions that will lead us into physical or
spiritual captivity.

1. Write in your scripture study journal one or two

examples of actions that modern prophets warn against
and how those actions could lead to physical and spiritual
captivity.

Despite the brother of Jared’s warning, the people
chose to have a king. Read Ether 7:1-2 to learn if the
brother of Jared’s prophecy was fulfilled in the days of
Orihah, who was a son of Jared. Think about what you
would say to someone who lived in the days of King
Orihah and did not believe that the brother of Jared’s
prophecy was going to be fulfilled.

Within two generations the brother of Jared’s prophetic
warning was fulfilled. Read Ether 7:3-7, and discover
how Kib and his people dwelt in captivity under
Corihor, whose selfish desire to be the king brought
him to rebel against his father. This captivity was the
result of selfishness and rebellion.

2. In your scripture study journal, write down what you

would say to people today who disobey the counsel of
the prophets but don't feel like they are in spiritual captivity. (In
your answer, you may want to include the idea that those
becoming entangled in spiritual captivity are often the last to
realize it. Give a modern situation of something that could place
someone in spiritual captivity.)

This portion of the history of the Jaredites illustrates
the principle that rejecting the words of the
prophets leads to captivity. Ponder ways you

may have experienced spiritual captivity because

of disobedience to the commandments or prophetic
counsel.

The rebellion of Corihor against his father, Kib, led to
ongoing strife and war. While in his old age, Kib had
another son—Shule. When Shule grew up, he fought
against his rebellious brother, Corihor.

3. Imagine you are a reporter assigned to cover the

story of Shule. Read Ether 7:8-13, and write a short
paragraph in your scripture study journal reporting what you
would highlight in your coverage of Shule’s life.

During Shule’s reign, many prophets came among
the people and warned them of their wickedness.
Read Ether 7:23-25, and identify what the prophets
prophesied and how the people reacted. How did
Shule react? How did Shule’s protection of the
prophets bless his people?

Read Ether 7:26-27, and look for what happened
when the people obeyed the words of the prophets.

304

Shule “remembered the great things that the Lord
had done for his fathers” (Ether 7:27). When you
remember the great things the Lord has done for
you, then you are more likely to have gratitude for
Him and live righteously.

These events testify of an important principle: As we
repent of our iniquities, we begin to prosper. The
word prosper means “hope” and also “succeed,” and it
“is often used in the sense of material success, [but] it
does not necessarily mean an abundance of temporal
possessions—or even a relatively comfortable,
problem-free life. ...

“The truly righteous are prosperous, in the sense

that they have confidence, which triggers faith into
activity and creates beneficial circumstances from
less-favorable ones. They do not wait for the Lord

to give or withhold rewards, but instead call on him
for guidance about what will be most beneficial for
them, both temporally and spiritually. Such guidance
may lead to changing occupations, moving to another
district, acquiring training or new skills, or accepting
things as they are but working within one’s own
limitations and following the Spirit’s direction in other
ways” (Alan Webster, “I Have a Question,” Ensign, Apr.
1990, 52-53).

4. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. How have you been blessed for heeding the words of the
prophets?

b. What is one thing you can do to better heed the words of the
prophets and qualify for the Lord’s blessings?

Ether 8:1-9:12

Jared and then Akish become kings of the Jaredites
through secret combinations

Read over the following list: music you listen to,
thoughts you entertain, how you act in school, movies
you watch, your dating behavior, activities you do
with your friends, what you do when no one else

is around. Why might someone who is engaged in
wicked behavior want to hide how they participate

in one or more of these activities from their friends,
parents, or leaders? What is the danger of engaging
in unrighteous secret activities?

According to Ether 8, Omer became the king after
Shule died, but Omer’s son Jared “rebelled against
his father” (Ether 8:2) and “set his heart upon the
kingdom and upon the glory of the world” (Ether
8:7). Jared’s daughter devised a plan with her father
that would give him the kingdom. She was a beautiful
woman, and when she danced before a man named
Akish, he wanted to marry her. Jared told Akish that

he could only marry his daughter “if ye will bring unto
me the head of my father, the king” (Ether 8:12). Akish
entered into a secret combination with his friends to kill
King Omer. A secret combination is where two or more
people swear oaths to keep their unrighteous acts secret
in order to avoid the consequences of their actions.

Read Ether 8:15-18, and identify words and phrases
that describe some of the motives and methods behind
those who embrace secret combinations.

5. Answer two or more of the following questions in
your scripture study journal:

a. Why do some people participate in secret combinations?

b. Why do you think it is spiritually destructive to believe you
can do “all manner of wickedness” (Ether 8:16) or “whatsoever
thing” you desire (Ether 8:17) without facing any consequences?
c. Which phrase in Ether 8:18 indicates how the Lord feels
about secret combinations? Why do you think such combinations
are considered “wicked above all”?

Read Ether 8:20-22, 25 and Ether 9:5-6, 11-12,
looking for the consequences of supporting secret
combinations. Summarize what you learned:

One of the truths you may have identified in these
verses is: Supporting secret combinations leads to
the destruction of individuals and societies.

Moroni paused in writing about the Jaredite wars to
speak to us. Read Ether 8:23-24, 26, and identify how
Moroni encouraged the people of our day to apply his
warnings about secret combinations.

Think about answers to the following questions: Why
do you think a nation, a society, or another group is
in an “awful situation” (Ether 8:24) when it has secret
combinations in its midst? How does secrecy give
power to these combinations? How can knowing the
truth about secret combinations help people do away
with this evil?

6. Refer back to the list of actions given at the beginning

of this portion of the lesson. Though making unrighteous
choices in these areas of your life would not necessarily be
categorized as a secret combination, write in your scripture study
journal the danger that comes from choosing to engage in
activities that a person would feel a need to keep secret from
others.

Ether 9:13-11:23

One king succeeds another—some are righteous, some
are wicked

As recorded in Ether 9-11, many kings ruled over
the Jaredites, some in righteousness and some in
wickedness. Read Ether 9:26—35 (during the reign of
Heth) and Ether 11:1-8 (during the reign of Com and
Shiblom), looking for evidence of the truthfulness

of the principle that rejecting the words of the
prophets leads to captivity, which was discussed
earlier in this lesson.

Recall the way you thought of to better heed the words
of the prophets. In the coming days, follow through
with this goal and look for opportunities to share your
testimony about the importance of obeying the words
of the prophets.

7. Write the following at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture study journal:

Ether 12

Introduction

After recounting many years of Jaredite history, Moroni
introduced the ministry of the prophet Ether. Moroni
then paused in his historical account and recorded
some of the blessings that come to those who exercise
faith in Jesus Christ. He also confessed a concern. He
was worried that those who would read the Book of
Mormon in the latter days would not accept it because
of his and the other writers’ weakness in writing.

The Lord promised Moroni that He strengthens the
weaknesses of all those who humble themselves
before Him and have faith.

Ether 12:1-4
Ether preaches repentance to the Jaredites

Why is it important for a boat to have an anchor? What
dangers or difficulties might a boat encounter if it does
not have an anchor? Label the boat in the picture My
life. Think about the following questions:

e Ifthe boat represents your life, what could the waves
be likened unto?

e If we compare the waves to difficulties and
wickedness, what might someone’s life be like if he
or she does not have an anchor? (See Mormon 5:18.)

e What has the Lord given you to help hold you
securely in place like an anchor?

As you study Ether 12, look for what you must do to
be like a boat with an anchor—firm and secure despite
the waves and pressures you face. Ether 12 begins
with Moroni introducing the prophet Ether, who lived

306

in a time when the people rejected the prophets and
lived in wickedness. Read Ether 12:1—3, and look for
anything that impresses you about Ether’s actions
during these difficult circumstances.

While going about exhorting the people to repent,
Ether taught what a person who believes in God can
hope for in spite of being surrounded by difficulties
and wickedness. Read Ether 12:4, and mark what that
hope is. (As you read, it may be helpful to know that
to have “a place at the right hand of God” means to
return to God’s presence and receive eternal life.)

1. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. How do you think having hope “with surety” is different
from merely wishing for something?

b. How does faith in Jesus Christ allow us to hope “with surety”
for a place at the right hand of God?

c. What phrases in Ether 12:4 describe the actions of someone
who has hope and faith in Jesus Christ?

On the picture of the boat at the beginning of this
lesson, label the anchor with the words faith and hope.

Ether 12:4 teaches the principle that when we have
hope and faith in Jesus Christ, we will receive
strength to be steadfast and abound in good works.

Ponder times when it may be difficult for you to be
steadfast (unwavering) and to abound in good works.
To help you in these situations and throughout your
life, look for ways you can increase your faith in the
Lord Jesus Christ as you continue to study Ether 12.

Ether 12:5-22

Moroni recounts miracles and mighty works that came
by faith

2. In your scripture study journal, finish the following

sentence with any gospel truths for which you are
seeking a spiritual witness: / would like to gain a spiritual
witness of...

Some people feel that they must first see evidence of

a truth and have it proven to them before they will

live it. Moroni spoke of that attitude in Ether 12:5-6.
Read these verses and mark those parts of his counsel
that stand out to you. (Ether 12:6 is a scripture mastery

passage.)
According to Ether 12:6, what must we have before

receiving a witness from the Lord? What comes to
mind when you think about a “trial of your faith”?
Some people mistakenly interpret “trial
of your faith” to always refer to hardship.
Elder Richard G. Scott of the Quorum of
the Twelve Apostles gave this insight into
what “trial of your faith” means: “You
can learn to use faith more effectively

by applying this principle taught by Moroni: ’.. . ye
receive no witness until after the trial of your faith’
[Ether 12:6; italics added]. Thus, every time you try
your faith, that is, act in worthiness on an impression,
you will receive the confirming evidence of the Spirit.
Those feelings will fortify your faith. As you repeat
that pattern, your faith will become stronger” (“The
Sustaining Power of Faith in Times of Uncertainty and
Testing,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2003, 76).

Read the following scripture passages, and look for the
blessings that came after the people exercised faith:

e Ether 12:11. What was the blessing?

e Ether 12:12-13. What blessing came to Alma and
Amulek?

e Ether 12:19-22, 30-31. What blessings came to the
brother of Jared by faith?

It may be helpful to notice the use of the word after in
Ether 12:7, 12, 17, 18, and 31.

3. Based on what you have studied in Ether 12, in your

own words, write in your scripture study journal what you
feel Moroni taught about receiving spiritual witnesses from the
Lord.

One of the principles Moroni taught was: If we desire
a witness, then we must first exercise faith in Jesus
Christ.

4. Read the following scenarios, and then write in your
scripture study journal how someone in two or more of
those situations could demonstrate faith in the Lord:

a. A young woman wants to receive a witness of the
truthfulness of the Book of Mormon.

b. A young man has a strong desire to help his loved ones
accept the gospel.

c. A young woman seeks for the Lord to bless her sick father.

5. Write in your scripture study journal about a time
when you or someone you know has received a witness
or miracle after demonstrating faith.

Think back on the principle or doctrine for which
you would like to receive a spiritual witness (see

assignment 2 in this lesson). What can you do to
demonstrate your faith before receiving the witness?

CO) Scripture Mastery—Ether 12:6

6. To help you memorize Ether 12:6, read it through

several times, then write down as much of the verse as
you can remember in your scripture study journal. Afterward,
compare what you wrote with the actual verse. Study the verse
again, and write it down a second time in your scripture study
journal.

Ether 12:23-41

Moroni expresses concern about how the Gentiles will
respond to the Book of Mormon

As recorded in Ether 12:23—41, Moroni expressed his
concern that those who would receive the Book of
Mormon in the latter days would not accept it because
of his and the other writers’ weakness in writing. As
you read the Lord’s response to Moroni’s concern in
Ether 12:26-27, look for how the Lord said that weak
things can become strong. (Ether 12:27 is a scripture
mastery passage.)

The scriptures sometimes indicate a gospel principle
by using the words if and then. The word if describes
what we must do, and then explains what will happen
as a result of our actions. Read Ether 12:27, identify an
ifthen principle, and write it below.

Ether 13-15

Introduction

The prophet Ether prophesied of the New Jerusalem.
He also warned Coriantumr, a Jaredite king, that his
people would be destroyed because of wickedness,
and he admonished Coriantumr and his household
to repent. When Coriantumr and the people refused
to repent, war and wickedness escalated for many
years until the entire Jaredite nation was destroyed.
Only Ether and Coriantumr survived to witness the
fulfillment of Ether’s prophecy.

Ether 13:1-12

Moroni records Ether's prophecies of the New Jerusalem
and the Jerusalem of old

Consider some cities today that have alternate names
indicating a significant feature of the city. For example,
Paris, France, is also known as the City of Light. To
begin, see if you can match the cities below with their
correct alternate names (answers are given at the end
of the lesson).

308

Cairo, Egypt The Windy City

Manila, Philippines The City of a Thousand

Minarets

Chicago, USA The Eternal City

Mexico City, Mexico The Pearl of the Orient

Rome, Italy

The City of Palaces

Today’s lesson draws attention to two significant
cities in the last days: (1) Jerusalem and (2) the New
Jerusalem. In the latter days these two cities will
become known for their righteousness. Ether taught
the Jaredites that the land upon which they lived was
the site for a future city called the New Jerusalem.

Read Ether 13:2-8. The Lord revealed to the Prophet
Joseph Smith that the New Jerusalem identified in
Ether 13:6 would be built in Jackson County, Missouri,
USA (see D&C 57:1-4; 84:1-4). What did Ether say
about these cities in Ether 13:3, 5? Ponder what it
would be like to live in a city like that. Study Ether
13:10-11 to learn what someone must experience in
order to live in the holy cities of the New Jerusalem
and Jerusalem of old (which will be holy when it is
rebuilt unto the Lord; see Ether 13:5).

Another name for the New Jerusalem is Zion (see
Moses 7:62; Articles of Faith 1:10). While we may not
live in Jerusalem or the New Jerusalem, all members
of the Church can be seeking to establish Zion. We can
prepare to dwell in holy places, including the celestial
kingdom of God, as we become clean through the
Atonement of Jesus Christ.

Ether 13:13-15:34

The Jaredites reject Ether and persist in wickedness and
war until they are destroyed

Read Ether 13:13-19, and look for the conditions of the
Jaredite society in Ether’s day. Study Ether 13:20-22
to discover Ether’s message to Coriantumr and how
Coriantumr and his people responded.

1. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. In what ways have you seen people in our day harden their
hearts and reject the Lord’s servants?

b. What will you do to keep yourself strong in the faith and
heeding the words of the prophets?
As recorded in Ether 13:23-14:20, Coriantumr fought
battles with several men who tried to take the kingdom
from him, including Shared, Gilead, and Lib. Eventually,
the entire Jaredite nation became engulfed in war.
Coriantumr’s final enemy was a man named Shiz. The
extent of the destruction among the Jaredites from these
wars is detailed in Ether 14:21-25 and Ether 15:1-2.

Read Ether 15:36 to discover what Coriantumr
attempted to do to spare the remainder of the people
from destruction. Think about why Shiz rejected
Coriantumr’s proposal and why the people in both
armies refused to surrender (see also Ether 14:24).

Read Ether 15:12-17, and look for details about the
Jaredites’ situation. What do you find particularly
tragic or sorrowful about their condition? Remember
that Ether had spent many years warning the people
to repent (see Ether 12:2—3; 13:20). Read Ether
15:18-19, and identify the consequences that come
from rejecting the Lord’s warnings to repent. Based
on what you read, complete this statement: If we
reject the Lord’s warnings to repent, then

In the space above, you may have written a principle
such as the following: If we reject the Lord’s
warnings to repent, His Spirit withdraws and
Satan gains power over our hearts.

2. Using Ether 15:19 and the principle we learn from it,
explain why one or more of the following rationalizations
that someone might give today for refusing to repent are wrong:

a. | know the movies | watch are not in harmony with Church
standards, but they don’t seem to have an effect on me.

b. Drinking alcohol with my friends isn’t that bad. We're just
having fun.

c. It is just a little pornography. It is not like | am going out
and being immoral. Besides, | can stop anytime | feel like it.

d. | don’t have to repent now. That can wait until I’m about
to go on a mission or get married in the temple.

Ether 15:20-32 relates how the two Jaredite armies
fought each other until only their leaders, Coriantumr
and Shiz, remained. Then Coriantumr killed Shiz.

The history of the Jaredites provides a vivid example of
what happens to a people when they collectively reject
God’s repeated efforts to convince them to repent.
While we may not face immediate physical destruction
by refusing to repent, we will experience feelings of
guilt if we reject the Lord’s warnings to repent.

Reflect upon the following statement
from Elder Neil L. Andersen of the
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles: “I testify
that the Savior is able and eager to forgive
our sins. Except for the sins of those few
who choose perdition after having known
a fulness, there is no sin that cannot be forgiven. What
a marvelous privilege for each of us to turn away from
our sins and to come unto Christ. Divine forgiveness is
one of the sweetest fruits of the gospel, removing guilt
and pain from our hearts and replacing them with joy
and peace of conscience” (“Repent . ..That I May Heal
You,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2009, 40-41).

Examine anything you might be doing that may be
interfering with the influence of the Holy Ghost in your
life. Consider how you might draw upon the power of
Jesus Christ’s Atonement to make the necessary changes
that will help you receive the Spirit and resist the power
of Satan.

From Ether 13-15 we learn that anger and vengeance
lead us to make choices that hurt ourselves and
others. Read or reread the following passages, and
mark words or phrases that teach this truth: Ether
13:27; 14:24; 15:6, 22, 28.

Ponder what consequences uncontrolled anger can
have on a family or other relationships. Think about a
situation in your life where you might need to forsake
feelings of anger or revenge.

As you read the following statement by Elder David E.
Sorensen, an emeritus member of the Seventy, look for
how you can overcome feelings of anger or a desire to
seek revenge: “When someone has hurt us or those
we care about, that pain can almost be overwhelming.

It can feel as if the pain or the injustice is the most
important thing in the world and that we have no

309
choice but to seek vengeance. But Christ, the Prince
of Peace, teaches us a better way. It can be very difficult
to forgive someone the harm they've done us, but
when we do, we open ourselves up to a better future.
No longer does someone else’s wrongdoing control
our course. When we forgive others, it frees us to
choose how we will live our own lives. Forgiveness
means that problems of the past no longer dictate
our destinies, and we can focus on the future with
God's love in our hearts” (“Forgiveness Will Change
Bitterness to Love,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2003, 12).

3. Answer the following question in your scripture
study journal: When have you or someone you know
experienced healing and freedom after choosing to forgive?

You can overcome any feelings of anger and revenge
if you will turn to Jesus Christ and receive the power
of forgiveness and comfort through His Atonement.
Remember to turn to the Lord in prayer for the help
you may need in those situations.

INTRODUCTION TO

Moroni

Why Study This Book?

As you study the book of Moroni, you can draw
strength from Moroni’s powerful example and
testimony. In addition, from the teachings of Moroni
and his father, Mormon, you will learn about basic
ordinances and practices of the Church of Jesus Christ,
the importance of doing righteous works with real
intent, the way to judge between good and evil, and
the relationship between faith, hope, and charity. You
will also read Moroni’s exhortation to pray to know for
yourself that the Book of Mormon is true and to “come
unto Christ and be perfected in him” (Moroni 10:32).

Who Wrote This Book?

Moroni wrote this book, which includes his words,

the words of Jesus Christ to His twelve disciples (see
Moroni 2), and the words of his father, Mormon (see
Moroni 7-9). Before the destruction of the Nephites,
Moroni served as a military and Church leader among
them (see Mormon 6:12; Moroni 8:1). Like other major
writers and compilers of the Book of Mormon, Moroni
was a witness of the Savior. He testified: “| have seen
Jesus, and... he hath talked with me face to face”
(Ether 12:39). Moroni was faithful to his testimony
and emphasized his willingness to be killed rather
than deny Christ (see Moroni 1:1-3).

In 1823, approximately 1,400 years after he completed
the record of the Book of Mormon, Moroni appeared
to the Prophet Joseph Smith as a resurrected being and
informed him that the record was deposited in a hill
near Joseph Smith’s home. At that time and during the
next several years, Moroni also instructed Joseph Smith
“respecting what the Lord was going to do, and how
and in what manner his kingdom was to be conducted
in the last days” (Joseph Smith—History 1:54).

When and Where Was It Written?

Moroni probably wrote and compiled this book
between the years A.D. 401 and A.D. 421 (see Mormon
8:4-6; Moroni 10:1), as he wandered for the safety of
his life (ee Mormon 1:1-3).

Moroni 1—5

Introduction

After completing his abridgment of the plates of Ether,
Moroni explained that he “had supposed not to have
written more” (Moroni 1:1). However, he was preserved
to “write a few more things, that perhaps they may be
of worth” to those in the last days (Moroni 1:4). Moroni
1-5 affirm Moroni’s faithfulness to Jesus Christ. They
also outline instructions for important ordinances of the
gospel, including the administration of the sacrament.

Moroni 1

Moroni wanders for the safety of his life and continues
his writings

Elder David E. Sorenson, an emeritus member of the
Seventy, told the following story about a young woman
who had the courage to stand up for her beliefs:

“My granddaughter Jennifer was invited to go with
several of her school friends to a dinner and a movie.
The girls all agreed on the movie they were going to
see, and Jennifer was comfortable attending. However,
the girl who left dinner to buy the movie tickets for
the group returned with tickets to a different movie
than was planned! She said, ‘It is a great show, and
it’s R-rated.’

“Jennifer, caught by surprise, couldn’t believe the
situation had changed so quickly. But fortunately she
had made up her mind before she ever found herself
in this position that she would not watch R-rated
movies. She was able to stand firm and say to her
friends, ‘I can’t go see an R-rated movie. My parents
would not approve.’ To which the girls replied, ‘Oh,
come on! Your parents will never know!’ Confronted
with this, Jennifer went on to say, ‘Well, actually it
doesn’t matter whether my parents will know. I just
don’t go to R-rated movies!’

“Her friends were upset and tried to get her to relent.
They told her she ‘was ruining everything.’ When she
would not give in, they threw the ticket and change
in her face and deserted her for the R-rated movie. It
wound up being a lonely night full of rejection from
her friends. But it was a great moment for Jennifer
and our family. She gained confidence, self-worth,
and spiritual power” (“You Can’t Pet a Rattlesnake,”
Ensign, May 2001, 42).

311
Read Moroni 1:1-3, and look for how Moroni stood
alone for his beliefs. Moroni and Elder Sorensen’s
granddaughter both exemplify ways in which
individuals can choose to stand up for that which
they know is right. You too can make seemingly small
decisions every day that demonstrate your faith,
obedience, and desire to follow Christ.

1. Write in your scripture study journal about a time
when you chose to stand up for your beliefs or to
demonstrate your faith through obedience.

Think about how you can better stand up for your
belief in Jesus Christ. Read Moroni 1:4 to discover why
Moroni chose to write more. What can we learn from
Moroni’s example and motivation to write more to
the descendants of those seeking his life? What might
you write to your own descendants that would be a
blessing to them? As you study Moroni 2-5, consider
how the things Moroni chose to write about are “of
worth” to you (Moroni 1:4).

Moroni 2

Moroni records instructions on conferring the gift of the
Holy Ghost

Think about your experience being confirmed a
member of the Church and having hands laid on your
head so you could receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
What do you remember about this ordinance? Read
Moroni 2:1—3, and consider how the gift of the Holy
Ghost has been a blessing in your life.

One gospel truth taught in these verses is this:
Worthy members holding proper priesthood
authority can bestow the gift of the Holy Ghost
on baptized members by the laying on of hands.

Moroni 3

Moroni records instructions on ordaining individuals to
priesthood offices

Have you ever seen a record of someone’s priesthood
line of authority? This record shows who ordained

an individual to the priesthood and who in turn
ordained that person and so on back to Jesus Christ.
Perhaps you have a copy of your own priesthood line
of authority or have seen a brother’s or father’s. Think
about the significance of being able to trace the line
of authority directly to Jesus Christ as you read the
following statement from Elder Jeffrey R. Holland

of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles:

312

“Clearly, acting with divine authority
requires more than mere social contract.
It cannot be generated by theological
training or a commission from the
congregation. No, in the authorized
work of God there has to be power
greater than that already possessed by the people in
the pews or in the streets or in the seminaries—a fact
that many honest religious seekers had known and
openly acknowledged for generations leading up to
the Restoration. . . .

“ ., We in the restored Church of Jesus Christ can
trace the priesthood line of authority exercised by the
newest deacon in the ward, the bishop who presides
over him, and the prophet who presides over all of us.
That line goes back in an unbroken chain to angelic
ministers who came from the Son of God Himself,
bearing this incomparable gift from heaven” (“Our
Most Distinguishing Feature,” Ensign or Liahona, May
2005, 44).

Each person who receives the Aaronic or Melchizedek
priesthood is also ordained to a priesthood office that
includes certain duties. Read Moroni 3:1—4, and look
for how individuals are ordained to priesthood offices,
including the office of priest or teacher.

You may want to write the following truth in your
scriptures next to these verses: Individuals are
ordained to priesthood offices by the laying on
of hands by those having authority.

2. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. Why do you think it is necessary for an individual to be
ordained to a priesthood office by someone who already holds
the priesthood?

b. How is having the authority of the priesthood in the Church
or in your family of worth to you?

Moroni 4-5
Moroni explains how the sacrament is to be administered

3. Think about the emblems of the sacrament and about
your experiences of partaking of the sacrament. Then do
the following in your scripture study journal:

a. From memory, as best you can, write out one of the
sacrament prayers, either for the bread or for the water.

b. After reviewing these sacred prayers (see Moroni 4:3; 5:2)
and checking what you wrote in the first part of this assignment,
write about a part of one of the sacrament prayers that stands
out to you, and explain why that portion of the prayer is
meaningful to you.

Moroni included the prayers for the administration of
the sacrament in his record because he felt they would
be “of worth” to people “in some future day” (Moroni
1:4). Read Moroni 4:1-3 and 5:1-2, and identify phrases
that explain what the sacramental bread and water
represent. As you read, it may be helpful to remember
that today the Church uses water in the sacrament
instead of wine as a result of a revelation given to the

Prophet Joseph Smith (see D&C 27:2).

Summarize the purpose of the sacrament by
completing this statement: The emblems of the
sacrament help us remember

Contemplate why the Savior’s body and blood are
significant to you.

The physical suffering, death, and Resurrection of
the Savior’s body and His intense spiritual suffering,
evidenced through the shedding of His blood, made
possible a remission of sins for all people who exercise
faith in Him and repent. The emblems of the
sacrament help us remember the Atonement of
Jesus Christ.

4. Answer one or both of the following questions in your
scripture study journal:
a. How has sincerely pondering the Savior's Atonement during
the sacrament helped or strengthened you spiritually?

b. What can you do to better focus on remembering the Savior's
Atonement during the sacrament?

To help you understand what you promise to do as
you partake of the sacrament, review Moroni 4:3 and
complete the following chart:

What I covenant
to do

What I think it
means to keep
this part of the

What I can do
to better keep
this part of the

covenant covenant

We also learn from Moroni 4:3 that as we faithfully
keep our part of the covenant of the sacrament, we
can always have the Lord’s Spirit to be with us.

As you read the following statement from Elder

David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles,
think about how you have experienced the gift of the
Holy Ghost in the ways he mentions: “The Spirit of the
Lord can be our guide and will bless us with direction,
instruction, and spiritual protection during our mortal
journey” (“That We May Always Have His Spirit to Be
with Us,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2006, 31).

Ponder the Savior’s Atonement as you partake of the
sacrament on Sunday. Try to keep the parts of the
covenant that you identified in the chart so you can
always have the Lord’s Spirit with you.

Moroni 6

Introduction

Moroni neared the completion of his writings on the
plates by explaining some of the qualifications for a
person to be prepared for baptism into the Church.
He then outlined the responsibilities members of
the Church have to care for other members. Moroni
also explained the purpose of Church meetings and
emphasized the need for Church meetings to be
conducted by the influence of the Holy Ghost.

Moroni 6:1-3

Moroni sets forth the requirements for baptism

Imagine you have a seven-year-old sibling who will be
eight in a few months. Your parents have asked you to

teach a family home evening lesson on how to prepare
for baptism.

1. If you were to teach that lesson right now, what
would you teach in order to help your sibling prepare to
be baptized? Write your thoughts in your scripture study journal.

314

After including the sacrament prayers in his record (see
Moroni 4-5), Moroni added instruction concerning the
ordinance of baptism. Search Moroni 6:1-3, looking for
the requirements for baptism. You may wish to mark
the requirements you identify in your scriptures.

What do you think it means that those wanting to be
baptized were to bring “forth fruit meet that they were
worthy of it”? (Moroni 6:1).

Ponder what you think it means to have “a broken
heart and a contrite spirit” (Moroni 6:2) before being
baptized. As recorded in Moroni 6:1-3, Moroni
explained that through baptism we covenant to
take upon us the name of Jesus Christ and serve
Him to the end. What are you doing to maintain and
strengthen your determination to serve Jesus Christ?

2. In your scripture study journal, describe some ways
that you have tried since your baptism to maintain and
strengthen your determination to serve Jesus Christ.

Moroni 6:4

Moroni explains how to care for and spiritually nourish
members of the Church

After explaining the requirements individuals should
meet before being baptized, Moroni then explained
how those who were newly baptized remained faithful
to their covenants. Read Moroni 6:4, and look for what
was done to help new converts remain faithful.

Summarize what you learn from Moroni 6:4 about

your responsibilities toward other members of the
Church.

What blessings does Moroni 6:4 indicate will come
from being nourished by the word of God?

One important truth taught in Moroni 6:4 is that we
have a responsibility to remember and spiritually
nourish other members of the Church.

Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles testified of the importance of nourishing each
other with the word of God: “Most people don’t come
to church looking merely for a few new gospel facts or
to see old friends, though all of that is important. They
come seeking a spiritual experience. They want peace.
They want their faith fortified and their hope renewed.
They want, in short, to be nourished by the good word
of God, to be strengthened by the powers of heaven.
Those of us who are called upon to speak or teach or
lead have an obligation to help provide that, as best
we possibly can” (“A Teacher Come from God,” Ensign,
May 1998, 26).

Have you ever thought about the great number

of individuals who have prayed for you, prepared
lessons for you, encouraged you and your activity
in the Church, and helped you through challenges?

3. In your scripture study journal, write about two or
three people who have remembered you in a meaningful
way or nourished you spiritually.

Sometime soon, discuss with a family member or
friend how you have been blessed because someone
remembered you or nourished you by the word of God.

President Henry B. Eyring of the First Presidency told
the story of a deacon in his ward who understood the
need to fulfill his responsibility to other members of
his quorum:

“One of his quorum members lived

near my home. That neighbor boy had
never attended a quorum meeting nor
done anything with the members of his
quorum. His stepfather was not a member,
and his mother did not attend church.

“The presidency of his deacons quorum met in council
one Sunday morning. . . . In their presidency meeting,
those 13-year-old shepherds remembered the boy
who never came. They talked about how much he
needed what they received. The president assigned his
counselor to go after that wandering sheep.

“T knew the counselor, and I knew he was shy, and I
knew the difficulty of the assignment, so I watched
with wonder through my front window as the
counselor trudged by my house, going up the road to
the home of the boy who never came to church. The
shepherd had his hands in his pockets. His eyes were
on the ground. He walked slowly, the way you would
if you weren't sure you wanted to get where you were
headed. In 20 minutes or so, he came back down the
road with the lost deacon walking by his side. That
scene was repeated for a few more Sundays. Then the
boy who had been lost and was found moved away.

“... Years later, I was in a stake conference, a continent
away from the room in which that presidency had met
in council. A gray-haired man came up to me and said
quietly, ‘My grandson lived in your ward years ago.’
With tenderness, he told me of that boy’s life. And
then he asked if I could find that deacon who walked
slowly up that road. And he wondered if I could thank

him and tell him that his grandson, now grown to be
a man, still remembered” (“Watch with Me,” Ensign,
May 2001, 38-39).

Consider specific individuals whom the Lord may want
you to “remember” or “nourish.” Plan a way that you
can help nourish them spiritually. Write their names on
a piece of paper, and place it in a location that will help
you remember them.

Moroni 6:5—9

Moroni describes the purpose of Church meetings and
how they are to be conducted

Imagine you are the parent of a teenager who, for
the past few weeks, has said that he or she does not
want to go to church because it seems meaningless
and boring. Consider what you would say to help
encourage your child to attend church and to
understand the right reasons for attending regularly.

In his record, Moroni was inspired to describe the
reasons that members of the Church met together in
his day. Study Moroni 6:5—6, and look for how you
could complete the following statement: As Church
members, we are to meet together often to

Elder Dallin H. Oaks of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles shared a portion of a letter from a friend
expressing a change in attitude about church
attendance:

“A wise friend wrote:

“Nears ago, [changed my attitude about
going to church. No longer do I go to
church for my sake, but to think of others.
I make a point of saying hello to people
who sit alone, to welcome visitors, . . . to
volunteer for an assignment. ...

“Tn short, I go to church each week with the intent
of being active, not passive, and making a positive
difference in people’s lives. Consequently, my
attendance at Church meetings is so much more
enjoyable and fulfilling.’

“All of this illustrates the eternal principle that we
are happier and more fulfilled when we act and serve
for what we give, not for what we get” (“Unselfish
Service,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2009, 96).

You might have completed the statement above with
some of the following ideas.

315
As Church members, we are to meet together
often to:

¢ Fast and pray.

¢ Strengthen each other spiritually.

¢ Partake of the sacrament in remembrance of
the Lord Jesus Christ.

Reflect upon experiences you have had that taught
you the importance of praying or fasting together with
members of your ward or branch.

4. Answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal:

a. How would your experience at church change if you
attended with the desire to strengthen others spiritually?
b. Why is it valuable to partake often of the sacrament in
remembrance of Jesus Christ?

c. How can going to church for the purposes listed above help
to “keep [you] in the right way”? (Moroni 6:4).

Read Moroni 6:7-8, and look for what the members

of the Church in Moroni’s day were “strict to observe,”
or in other words, what they paid special attention to.
Why do you think it is important that we teach and
encourage each other to avoid and repent of sin?

Moroni testified that as often as we repent and seek
forgiveness with real intent, we will be forgiven. You
may wish to mark this truth in Moroni 6:8.

Moroni concluded this chapter by teaching how our
Church meetings should be conducted. Read Moroni
6:9, and identify who should guide our meetings in the
Church. Think of a time when you were particularly
aware of the influence of the Holy Ghost during a
Church meeting.

How can the principle that Church meetings are to be
conducted by the power of the Holy Ghost apply to

you? If you were asked to give a talk or teach a lesson
during a Church meeting, how could you help ensure

316

that what you say contributes to the guidance and
influence of the Holy Ghost during that meeting?

5. In your scripture study journal, write a plan of how you

are going to approach your Church meetings this coming
Sunday. You may want to include ways to invite the Holy Ghost
into your worship and how you might remember and nourish
others through your attendance.

6. Write the following at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture study journal:

with my teacher:

Moroni 7:1-19

Introduction

Moroni recorded a sermon that his father, Mormon,
had delivered to his “beloved brethren” many years
earlier (Moroni 7:2).This lesson covers the first portion
of Mormon’s sermon found in Moroni 7. It addresses
his teachings on doing righteous works with real intent
and his explanation of how we can discern between
good and evil. In the next lesson you will study the
remainder of Mormon’s sermon in Moroni 7.

Moroni 7:1-10

Mormon teaches the followers of Jesus Christ about works
and intent

Have you ever discovered that something was not as
good on the inside as it appeared on the outside? One
example of this might be a piece of fruit, such as an

apple that was sour or too ripe. List two or three other
examples you can think of:

Consider how these examples of things that appear
good on the outside but in reality are not might be
compared to the outer appearance and inner motives
of people. Moroni recorded the words of his father,
Mormon, concerning the state of our hearts as we do
righteous works. Read Moroni 7:2—3 to identify the
audience Mormon was addressing.

Mormon referred to his brethren whom he was
speaking to as “the peaceable followers of Christ”
(Moroni 7:3). Study Moroni 7:4—5 to discover how
Mormon knew these Nephites were truly disciples
of the Savior.

Do you think a person can merely pretend to be
righteous? Why or why not?

Mormon addressed this issue in Moroni 7:6. As you
study this verse, you may want to mark the phrase
“real intent.” The following explanation from Elder
Dallin H. Oaks of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
can help you understand what it means to have real
intent. Underline those portions of his explanation
that stand out to you.

“We must not only do what is right. We must act for
the right reasons. The modern term is good motive. The
scriptures often signify this appropriate mental attitude
with the words full purpose of heart or real intent.

“The scriptures make clear that God understands our
motives and will judge our actions accordingly” (Pure
in Heart [1988], 15).

Mormon described the results of a person seeking to do
good works without real intent. Search Moroni 7:7-10,
and identify what happens when we do righteous acts
without the right intent. From these verses we learn that
to be blessed for good works, we must do them with
real intent of heart. Real intent includes doing good
works out of a love for God and others.

1. Answer the following question in your scripture study

journal: What differences have you noticed when you
have done good works with the right intent as opposed to having
done something gocd with a selfish intent?

2. To help you better understand the principle that to be

blessed for good works, we must do them with real intent
of heart, consider the following scenario: A friend who has been
reading the Book of Mormon asks for your help in understanding
Moroni 7:9 and says, “| read that if a person prays without real
intent, ‘it profiteth him nothing, for God receiveth none such.’ |
often feel like | don’t pray with real intent. Should | just quit

praying?” In your scripture study journal, write how you would
respond to that question, and explain why you would respond
that way.

President Brigham Young gave this helpful counsel on
how we can gain a desire to pray with real intent: “It
matters not whether you or I feel like praying, when
the time comes to pray, pray. If we do not feel like it,
we should pray till we do” (Teachings of Presidents of
the Church: Brigham Young [1997], 45).

Think about how President Young’s counsel could
relate to obeying other commandments besides prayer.
Often doing what is right can help bring a desire to
continue obeying that commandment for the right
reasons.

3. To apply Mormon’s teachings on the importance

of doing good works with real intent, choose one of the
following commandments: fasting, paying tithing, serving others,
studying the scriptures, honoring parents, staying morally clean.
(Staying morally clean includes being virtuous while using the
Internet or social media. It also includes not doing anything that
could lead to sexual transgression.) Then answer the following
questions in your scripture study journal:

a. How have you been blessed when you have sought to obey
that commandment with real intent?

b. What advice would you give to your peers on how to obey
that commandment with real intent?

Moroni 7:11-19
Mormon teaches how to judge between good and evil

How can we tell that something is evil without actually
trying it? Mormon offered counsel to help us when
facing such a situation.

4. Read Moroni 7:11-13, and look for how to judge
good from evil. You may wish to mark phrases that
stand out to you. Summarize what you learn from these verses
by completing the following statements in your scripture study
journal:
a. That which is of God...

b. That which comes from the devil. . .

Mormon affirmed that God invites and entices us to do
good continually. Notice that according to Moroni 7:12,
the devil also invites and entices us. Think about some

ways the devil invites and entices you to sin.

Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum
of the Twelve Apostles discussed Satan’s
motives for seeking to entice us to do
evil continually: “Satan, or Lucifer, or the
father of lies—call him what you will—is
real, the very personification of evil. His
motives are in every case malicious... . He is eternally

317
opposed to the love of God, the Atonement of Jesus
Christ, and the work of peace and salvation. He will
fight against these whenever and wherever he can.
He knows he will be defeated and cast out in the end,
but he is determined to take down with him as many
others as he possibly can” (“We Are All Enlisted,”
Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2011, 44).

5. To help you prepare to apply Mormon’s teachings on

judging between good and evil, list in your scripture study
journal several of your favorite TV shows, songs, music groups,
Internet sites, apps, video games, or personal possessions. (You
may want to modify this list according to your interests.) You will
come back to this journal entry later in this lesson.

Read Moroni 7:15-17, and look for truths that will help
you know how to judge whether something is of God
or of the devil.

The Spirit of Christ is also called the Light of Christ
(see Moroni 7:18). President Boyd K. Packer, President
of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, gave this

explanation that can help you better understand the
Light of Christ:

“The Holy Ghost and the Light of Christ
are different from each other. While they
are sometimes described in the scriptures
with the same words, they are two
different and distinct entities. . . .

“The more we know about the Light of
Christ, the more we will understand about life and the
more we will have a deep love for all mankind. .. .

“Regardless of whether this inner light, this knowledge
of right and wrong, is called the Light of Christ, moral
sense, or conscience, it can direct us to moderate our
actions—unless, that is, we subdue it or silence it... .

“Every man, woman, and child of every nation, creed,
or color—everyone, no matter where they live or what
they believe or what they do—has within them the
imperishable Light of Christ. In this respect all men
are created equally. The Light of Christ in everyone

is a testimony that God is no respecter of persons”
(“The Light of Christ,” Ensign, Apr. 2005, 8-10).

Baptized members of the Church also have the gift of
the Holy Ghost to help them discern between good and
evil. President Packer taught, “The Holy Ghost can work
through the Light of Christ” (“Light of Christ,” 10).

318

Search Moroni 7:18-19 to find Mormon’s counsel on
how to respond to the Light of Christ within us. You may
want to mark words or phrases in these verses indicating
that as we search diligently to follow the Light of
Christ, we can discern between good and evil.

Refer to the list you made in your scripture study
journal in assignment 5. Carefully ponder the items on
yout list, and “search diligently in the light of Christ”
(Moroni 7:19) to determine whether or not these
items come from God. The following questions may be
helpful to consider:

e How well do these things invite you to do good, to
believe in Christ, to love God and serve Him?

e Do any of these persuade you “to do evil, . . . believe
not in Christ, . .. deny Him, [or] serve not God”?
(Moroni 7:17).

¢ Do you feel you should remove any of these items
from yout life? If so, how will you do this?

Mormon offered the promise that as you choose to
remove anything from your life that is not good and
seek to “lay hold upon every good thing,” you become
“a child of Christ” (Moroni 7:19).

6. Write the following at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture study journal:

Additional questions, thoughts, and insights | would like to share
with my teacher:

Moroni 7:20—48

Introduction

As recorded in Moroni 7:20—48, Mormon continued
his sermon in the synagogue by teaching his listeners
how to “lay hold upon every good thing” (Moroni
7:20-21, 25). He explained the importance of faith,
hope, and charity. He concluded his sermon with a
plea that his listeners would pray to the Father with
all the energy of their hearts for the gift of charity—
which Mormon defined as “the pure love of Christ”
(Moroni 7:47).
Moroni 7:20-39
Mormon teaches about faith in Jesus Christ

Review Moroni 7:12-13, and consider what you
learned in the previous lesson about how to tell good
things from evil things. In the space provided, list
examples of good things (things that come from God
and persuade us to believe in Christ) and evil things
(things that persuade us not to believe in Christ and
not to serve God):

Good Things Evil Things

Notice that Mormon encouraged us to “lay hold upon
every good thing” (Moroni 7:19). Ponder what you
think it means to lay hold on every good thing.

Mormon asked his listeners an important question,
which he then went on to answer. Read Moroni 7:20,
and find the question Mormon planned to address.
Then search Moroni 7:21—26, looking for the answer
to this question.

As you look at Moroni 7:21, 25, mark words or phrases
that teach this principle: As we exercise faith in Jesus
Christ, we can lay hold upon every good thing.

1. In your scripture study journal, answer the following
questions:

a. According to Moroni 7:22-26, in what ways does Heavenly
Father seek to help us build faith in Jesus Christ?

b. When has your faith in Jesus Christ helped you lay hold
upon a good thing or helped you dismiss something evil?

Mormon went on to describe several of the good
things that come to those who exercise faith in Jesus
Christ. Read Moroni 7:32-34, and mark at least one
blessing in each of these verses that results from
having faith in Jesus Christ.

2. Think of and pray about something you can do to

exercise greater faith in Jesus Christ. When you have a
goal in mind, write it down in your scripture study journal. This
goal could be to do something specific that will help you follow
the words of the prophets (see Moroni 7:23), pray with greater
faith (see Moroni 7:26), or repent of a sin (see Moroni 7:34). As
you write your goal, include specific details about how you are
going to accomplish it. Also write how this goal will bring good
things into your life.

Moroni 7:40—43
Mormon teaches about hope

In the sermon recorded in Moroni 7, Mormon
identified three divine principles that are necessary
for eternal life. Elder M. Russell Ballard of the Quorum
of the Twelve Apostles taught that these “three divine
principles form a foundation upon which we can build
the structure of our lives.” He said that these three
principles “together give us a base of support like

the legs of a three-legged stool” (“The Joy of Hope
Fulfilled,” Ensign, Nov. 1992, 33).

The following material will help you find the three
principles that Mormon identified. The first principle is
faith, which you have just studied in Moroni 7:20-39.
Label one of the legs of the stool above Faith in Jesus
Christ. Find what the second leg represents by reading
Moroni 7:40. Write that principle by another leg of the
stool.

Read Moroni 7:41—42, and identify what Mormon
taught we should hope for. (Moroni 7:41 is a scripture
mastery passage.) You might wish to add “for eternal
life” to the label you put on the second leg of the stool
so that it reads “Hope for eternal life.”

President Dieter F. Uchtdorf of the First Presidency
spoke about the hope Mormon was referring to:

“Hope is a gift of the Spirit. It is a hope
that through the Atonement of Jesus
Christ and the power of His Resurrection,
we shall be raised unto life eternal and
this because of our faith in the Savior... .

“Hope is not knowledge, but rather the
abiding trust that the Lord will fulfill His promise to
us. It is confidence that if we live according to God’s
laws and the words of His prophets now, we will
receive desired blessings in the future. It is believing
and expecting that our prayers will be answered. It is
manifest in confidence, optimism, enthusiasm, and
patient perseverance” (“The Infinite Power of Hope,”
Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2008, 21-22).

319
One principle we learn from Moroni 7:40—42 is: If we

exercise faith in Jesus Christ, we can obtain a hope
through the Atonement of Jesus Christ to be raised
to eternal life.

Read Moroni 7:43, and identify characteristics that are
required in order for a person to have the faith and
hope that Mormon spoke of.

To be “meek, and lowly of heart” means to be truly
humble, gentle, and submissive to the Lord’s will.
Why do you think meekness and lowliness of heart
are necessary in order to have faith and hope in the
Atonement of Jesus Christ?

3. In your scripture study journal, describe how your
faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement has given you
hope.

Moroni 7:44—48
Mormon teaches about charity

Refer back to the stool diagram at the beginning of
the lesson. Read Moroni 7:44, and identify the third
principle taught by Mormon. Label the last leg of the
stool with this final principle.

As recorded in Moroni 7:44—48, Mormon gave a
powerful explanation of charity. Read Moroni 7:45—47,
and mark words or phrases that Mormon used to
define charity. (Moroni 7:45, 47-48 is a scripture
mastery passage.) To help you better understand what
Mormon was teaching, you might wish to write some
of these definitions in your scriptures: “suffereth long”
means to endure patiently, “envieth not” means to
not be jealous, “not puffed up” means to be humble
and meek, “seeketh not her own” means to put God
and others first, “not easily provoked” means to not
become angry easily, and “believeth all things” means
to accept all truth.

4. Inyour scripture study journal, answer one or more
of the following questions:

a. Based on the definition in Moroni 7:45—47, why do you
think charity is the greatest spiritual gift we can receive?

b. What do you think it means that charity will never fail?
c. Why do you think we are nothing if we do not have charity?
After mentioning the Apostle Paul’s teaching on charity

in 1 Corinthians 13, Elder Dallin H. Oaks of the Quorum
of the Twelve Apostles explained: “The reason charity

320

never fails and the reason charity is greater than even
the most significant acts of goodness he cited is that
charity, ‘the pure love of Christ’ (Moro. 7:47), is not an
act but a condition or state of being. Charity is attained
through a succession of acts that result in a conversion.
Charity is something one becomes. Thus, as Moroni
declared, ‘except men shall have charity they cannot
inherit’ the place prepared for them in the mansions
of the Father (Ether 12:34; emphasis added)” (’The
Challenge to Become,” Ensign, Nov. 2000, 34.)

Read the following situations and consider how you
might respond if you lacked the gift of charity and how
you might respond if you were filled with charity:

¢ Other students make fun of you or someone else
at school.

e You have a brother or sister who frequently annoys
you.

¢ You do not like one of your new quorum or class
advisers as much as you liked the previous leader.

After explaining how important it is that we develop
charity in our lives, Mormon explained how we can
acquire this vital character trait. Read Moroni 7:48, and
mark words or phrases that teach this principle: If we
pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart
and live as true followers of Jesus Christ, we can
be filled with charity. Ponder why it is important to
pray for the gift of charity with all the energy of your
heart rather than praying casually for this gift.

5. In your scripture study journal, write about a time

when you felt that the Lord helped you to be charitable. Or
write about a time when you saw someone else being charitable.
In addition, set a specific goal for how you will improve in one of
the characteristics of charity listed in Moroni 7:45. Pray for the
gift of charity as you strive to accomplish your goal.

CL) Scripture Mastery—Moroni 7:41

Write the entire verse on a piece of paper. Recite
the verse several times. Erase (or cross out) words
or phrases until you can recite the entire verse from
memory.

CL) Scripture Mastery—Moroni 7:45, 47-48

Write the first letter of every word in these three verses
on a piece of paper. Refer to the paper to help you
recite the verses. After you recite the verses several
times, erase or cross out letters until you can recite
the verses from memory. Then choose one of the
following groups of people for whom you would like
to have more charity: family, Church quorum or class
members, school classmates, friends, or neighbors.
Think about the people you chose as you read Moroni
7:45, and consider ways you will show these people
more Christlike love.

6. Write in your scripture study journal one or two ways

you will show greater charity for these people. During the
coming week, pray for the Lord’s help in developing greater
charity for them. At the end of the week, share your experience
with a friend or a family member.

Moroni 8-9

Introduction

Moroni 8 is an epistle (letter) Mormon wrote to his son
Moroni about why little children do not need baptism.
In the epistle, Mormon also taught about how we can
prepare to dwell with God. He concluded by expressing
concern for the wickedness and impending destruction
of the Nephites. Moroni 9 contains Mormon’s final
recorded epistle to his son. He expressed sorrow for the
wicked state of the Nephites and urged Moroni to labor
diligently to help the Nephites repent. Notwithstanding
the corrupt situation of his people, he encouraged his
son to be faithful in Christ and to let the promise of
eternal life rest on his mind forever.

Moroni 8:1-24

Mormon wrote to his son Moroni about those who need
baptism

Have you ever wondered why children in The Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are not baptized
until they are eight years old? In a letter written to his
son Moroni, Mormon taught some important truths
about the salvation of little children and baptism,
including why children aren’t baptized until they are
eight years old. Mormon began his letter to Moroni
by talking about a disputation (disagreement) the
Nephites were having. Read Moroni 8:4—6, and look
for the doctrine the Nephites were disputing about.
(As you read, it might be helpful to know that gross in
this context means extremely serious.)

Read Moroni 8:7, and identify what Mormon did
when he heard of this problem. The Savior answered
Mormon’s prayer by explaining why little children do
not need baptism before the age of accountability.
Read Moroni 8:8—9, and look for what the Savior said
about why infants and little children are not baptized.

In Moroni 8:8, the “curse of Adam” refers to Adam’s
separation from God’s presence as a result of the

Fall. Evidently, some Nephites did not understand
the doctrine of baptism. Therefore, they incorrectly
believed that little children were unworthy to be in
God’s presence without the ordinance of baptism,
and they wanted to baptize children when they were
very young. In understanding this verse, it may also
be helpful to note that sin is “willful disobedience

to God’s commandments” (Guide to the Scriptures,
“Sin,” scriptures.lds.org).To understand the doctrine in
this verse more fully, you may want to cross-reference
Moroni 8:8 with the second article of faith.

Read Moroni 8:10, and look for words that complete
the following truth: Repentance and baptism are
necessary for all who

Because repentance and baptism are necessary only for
those who are accountable and capable of committing
sin, Mormon taught that it is wrong to baptize little
children before they are accountable. Read Moroni
8:11-13, 18-22, and look for Mormon’s explanation

of why baptism of little children is wrong. These verses
teach this doctrine: Little children are saved through
the Atonement of Jesus Christ.

321
The Lord has set the age when accountability
begins—eight years old (see D&C 68:25-27; Joseph
Smith Translation, Genesis 17:11 [in Bible appendix]).
Before children turn eight, they cannot sin because
Satan is not given power to tempt little children (see
D&C 29:46-47). Any mistakes children make before
the age of eight are not considered sins.

Li

Elder Dallin H. Oaks of the Quorum

of the Twelve Apostles explained why
little children cannot commit sins: “We
understand from our doctrine that before
the age of accountability a child is ‘not
capable of committing sin’ (Moro. 8:8).
During that time, children can commit mistakes,
even very serious and damaging ones that must be

corrected, but their acts are not accounted as sins”
(“Sins and Mistakes,” Ensign, Oct. 1996, 65).

As part of his epistle, Mormon also testified that little
children are “alive in Christ” and that if they die before
they are eight years old, they are redeemed through the
Atonement of Jesus Christ (see Moroni 8:12-15, 22).

322

While explaining why infants and little children do not
need baptism, Mormon testified of this principle: God
is perfectly just in His dealings with His children.
This means God will ensure that everyone has a just
and fair chance to receive salvation.

1. The following activity can help you learn to explain

the doctrines taught in the first part of Moroni 8. Select
one (or both) of the situations below and, in your scripture study
journal, identify one or two verses from Moroni 8:8-24 that help
answer the person's concern in the situation. Then write a
paragraph or two responding to the situation. Use the scripture
verses in your response.

a. As a missionary, you meet a man who is sincerely seeking
truth. He explains that all his life he was taught that little
children are sinful when they are born because of Adam's
transgression. He is certain that when infants die without
being baptized, they are sinful and cannot be saved.

b. A recent convert agrees that baptism for eight-year-old
children is a good idea but asks, “It doesn’t really matter if
people are baptized when they are eight months old, or eight
years old, does it?”

Moroni 8:25-30
Mormon teaches what we must do to dwell with God

After teaching why little children do not need baptism,
Mormon taught that people who have reached the age
of accountability must be baptized. He also explained
what we must do after our baptism in order to dwell
with God.

Read Moroni 8:25—26, and look for what we must do
and the characteristics we must develop in order to
dwell with God. You might want to mark these things
in your scriptures. It may be helpful to understand that
“meekness” means being submissive to God’s will, and
“lowliness of heart” means being truly humble.

You may want to write the following principle in your
scriptures by Moroni 8:25—26: Through faithful
obedience to the commandments, we can receive
the Holy Ghost, which prepares us to dwell with
God.

2. The following questions will help you better

understand Moroni 8:25-26. Consider all of the
questions, and then select two or more of them to answer in your
scripture study journal:

a. Why do you think that receiving a remission of your sins can
lead to meekness and lowliness of heart?

b. How can being meek and lowly of heart invite the Holy Ghost
into your life?
c. How will having the Holy Ghost help you prepare to live
with God?

d. Mormon taught that if we want to be filled with love that
endures, we must pray diligently. Why do you think that diligent
prayer is necessary if we want to be filled with love?

As recorded in Moroni 8:27, Mormon condemned the
sin of pride among the Nephites. Read Moroni 8:27,
and look for the result of the Nephites’ pride. Then
compare this result with the results of being meek
and lowly of heart, found in Moroni 8:26.

Mormon encouraged Moroni to pray for the Nephites
so that perhaps they might repent and receive the
blessings he described in his letter (see Moroni
8:28-30). Using Mormon’s counsel to his son, consider
praying for specific individuals you know who need

to receive the blessings of the gospel, and seek to find
ways to help those individuals.

Moroni 9:1-20

Mormon describes the wickedness of the Nephites and
Lamanites

Recall a time when you tried to help someone and that
person rejected your efforts. How might some people
respond when their good intentions are repeatedly
rejected by those they are trying to help? As you study
Mormon’s second epistle to his son Moroni, found in
Moroni 9, look for what Mormon said to encourage his
son not to give up on the Nephites.

Read Moroni 9:1, and look for the word Mormon used
to describe the situation he would discuss in his letter.
Note that grievous in this context means extremely
disturbing. As recorded in Moroni 9:2-19, Mormon
described some of the disturbing things taking place
among the people, showing how wicked the people
had become. Like Ether, who was a prophet among
the Jaredites, Mormon witnessed the anger and
wickedness that had overcome his people. He feared
that the Spirit of the Lord had ceased striving with
them (see Moroni 9:4).

Ponder why Mormon continued to labor among the
Nephites even though they had hardened their hearts
toward the word of God and rejected the prophets’
efforts to help them.

Mormon gave Moroni some powerful counsel about
how he should minister to people whose hearts were
not open. Read Moroni 9:3—-6, and mark words or
phrases that teach this principle: We are to labor
diligently in God's service even if those we serve
do not respond positively. Verse 6 is particularly
helpful in teaching this principle.

Moroni 9:21—26
Mormon encourages Moroni to be faithful

Think about recent events in your community, nation,
or world that people might feel discouraged about.
Read Moroni 9:25—26 to discover the counsel Mormon
gave to Moroni about what to do in discouraging
circumstances.

3. Answer the following questions in your scripture study

journal: What did Mormon tell Moroni ought to “rest in
your mind forever”? (Moroni 9:25). How can remembering the
Savior and His Atonement help you when you are in difficulty or
surrounded by wickedness?

From Mormon’s counsel to Moroni, we can learn this
principle: If we are faithful in Jesus Christ, He can
lift us up even when difficulties and wickedness
surround us. Being “faithful in Christ” can mean
striving at all times to act like a true disciple of the
Savior, remembering the Savior and His Atonement,
and faithfully keeping His commandments.

4. Inyour scripture study journal, write about an
experience in your life or in the life of someone close to
you that demonstrates that the preceding principle is true.

Think about one way you can be more faithful in Christ
when you are surrounded by wickedness or difficult
circumstances.

5. Write the following at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture study journal:

Moroni 10:1—7, 27-29

Introduction

Moroni exhorted the Lamanites, and all others who
would read his testimony, to learn for themselves the
truth of his words by asking God. He taught that a
testimony of the Book of Mormon and of Jesus Christ
would come by the power of the Holy Ghost. Moroni
boldly declared that he would meet his readers before
the bar of God, where God would confirm the truth of
his words.

Moroni 10:1-7

Moroni exhorts us to obtain a testimony of the Book of
Mormon and of Jesus Christ

Review the introductory lessons on the Book of
Mormon in unit 1 of this manual. Can you remember
the purpose of the keystone in an arch and how a
keystone relates to the Book of Mormon? Turn to the
introduction to the Book of Mormon (found at the
beginning of the book), and read the statement from
the Prophet Joseph Smith in the sixth paragraph.

Keystone

The Prophet Joseph Smith described the Book of
Mormon as the “keystone” of our religion, meaning
that our testimony of the Book of Mormon holds up
and strengthens our testimony of all the truths of
the restored gospel. Read the last paragraph of the
introduction to the Book of Mormon, and look for
truths a person can come to know by obtaining a

324

testimony of the Book of Mormon. Just as a keystone
holds an arch together, how is your testimony held
together and strengthened by the Book of Mormon?

About 1,400 years before Joseph Smith received the
gold plates, Moroni concluded his father’s record

by writing his final exhortation to those who would
receive the Book of Mormon in the last days (see
Moroni 10:1—2). The word exhort means to strongly
encourage someone. Moroni used this word eight
times in the final chapter of the Book of Mormon. He
exhorted all who receive the Book of Mormon to seek
a testimony of its truth and divinity.

Read Moroni 10:3—4, and identify the things Moroni
said we should do to obtain a testimony of the Book of
Mormon. You may want to mark these things in your
scriptures. Study the following information about each
thing Moroni said we should do:

“Read these things”

The first step in gaining a witness that the Book of
Mormon is true is to read it. Elder Tad R. Callister of
the Presidency of the Seventy shared how one young
woman benefited from reading the entire Book of
Mormon:

“A 14-year-old girl... said that she had been
discussing religion with one of her friends at school.
Her friend said to her, ‘What religion do you belong
to?’

“She replied, ‘The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints, or Mormons.’

“Her friend replied, ‘I know that church, and I know
it’s not true.”

“How do you know?’ came the reply.

“ Because,’ said her friend, ‘I have researched it.’
“Have you read the Book of Mormon?’

“’No,’ came the answer. ‘I haven't.’

“Then this sweet young girl responded, ‘Then you
haven't researched my church, because I have read
every page of the Book of Mormon and I know it’s
true’” (“The Book of Mormon—a Book from God,”
Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2011, 76).

Why do you think that reading the Book of Mormon
is necessary in order to gain a testimony of its
truthfulness?

“Remember how merciful the Lord hath been”

The next step in the process is to “remember how
merciful the Lord hath been.” Remembering the Lord’s
mercies in our lives can soften our hearts and prepare
us to receive the Holy Ghost. Ponder times when you
have felt the Lord’s mercy in yout life.

In the beginning of the Book of Mormon, Nephi
declared that through his writings he would show us
examples of the Lord’s tender mercy (see 1 Nephi 1:20).
At the end of the Book of Mormon, Moroni asked us
to remember the mercies of the Lord to us (see Moroni
10:3). You might want to write the cross-reference

1 Nephi 1:20 next to Moroni 10:3.

1. In your scripture study journal, answer the following
questions:
a. What evidence of the Lord’s mercy have you seen in your
life?
b. How do you think remembering the Lord’s mercy helps
someone receive a testimony of the Book of Mormon?

Remembering the mercy of the Lord to others and
ourselves can prepare us to ponder the Book of
Mormon’s message for us.

“Ponder it in your hearts”

The next step Moroni taught is to “ponder it in your
hearts.” Elder Marvin J. Ashton of the Quorum of the
Twelve Apostles explained how pondering can help us
receive the Holy Ghost in our lives:

“As I study the scriptures, Iam challenged
and moved by the word ponder used

so frequently in the Book of Mormon.
Dictionaries say that ponder means to
weigh mentally, think deeply about,
deliberate, meditate. ... Moroni used
this term as he closed his record [see Moroni 10:3].

“By pondering, we give the Spirit an opportunity

to impress and direct. Pondering is a powerful link
between the heart and the mind. As we read the
scriptures, our hearts and minds are touched. If we use
the gift to ponder, we can take these eternal truths and
realize how we can incorporate them into our daily
actions. ...

“Pondering is a progressive mental pursuit. It is a
great gift to those who have learned to use it. We find
understanding, insight, and practical application if we
will use the gift of pondering” (“There Are Many Gifts,”
Ensign, Nov. 1987, 20).

2. In your scripture study journal, answer one or both of
the following questions:

a. How has pondering as you have studied the Book of Mormon
helped you feel the Holy Ghost?

b. What could you do to ponder more consistently and
effectively as you study the scriptures?

“Ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith
in Christ”

When people “pray sincerely and have real intent,”
it means that they “intend to act on the answer they
receive from God” (Preach My Gospel [2004], 111).

Aman named Rodolfo Armando Pérez Bonilla
learned the importance of praying with real intent.
He was baptized at age nine but his family was not
active in the Church. When he became a teenager,
he began thinking about the gospel and had the
following experience:

“Occasionally I prayed to know what was right, but it
was more of a passing thought than a sincere question.
Then one night I decided to pray with ‘real intent.’

“T told Heavenly Father that | wanted to know Him
and to be part of His true Church. I promised: ‘Tf

Thou will let me know whether Joseph Smith is a real
prophet and whether the Book of Mormon is true, I’ll
do whatever Thou would have me do. IfThe Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the true Church, I’ll
follow it and never give it up.’

325
“Thad no spectacular manifestation, but I felt at peace
and went to bed. Several hours later I awoke with a
distinct thought: ‘Joseph Smith is a true prophet, and the
Book of Mormon is true.’ The thought was accompanied
by an indescribable peace. I fell asleep again, only to
awake later with the exact same thought and feeling.

“Since that time, I have never doubted that Joseph
Smith is a true prophet. I know that this is the Savior’s
work and that Heavenly Father will answer our sincere
petitions” (“How I Know,” Ensign, Oct. 2011, 64).

3. Think about how much you want to have a strong

testimony of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon.
Write in your scripture study journal some of the things you have
already done to obtain a testimony of the Book of Mormon. Then
write what you could do to gain a stronger testimony of the Book
of Mormon.

Search Moroni 10:4, and identify what Moroni testified
God would do for those who follow this process of
reading, remembering, pondering, and asking. You may
want to mark this promise in your scriptures. (Moroni
10:4—5 is a scripture mastery passage.)

326

Read Moroni 10:5-7, and look for what else Moroni
promised we can know through the Holy Ghost.

One principle we can learn from Moroni 10:3-7 is:
If we seek in faith, we can receive a testimony of
the Book of Mormon and of Jesus Christ through
the Holy Ghost. You may want to write this in your
scriptures by these verses.

SN. 4. Do the following in your scripture study journal:

a. Record how reading, remembering, pondering, and
praying this year has strengthened your testimony of the Book
of Mormon and the truths it teaches or has helped you obtain
a testimony of it.

b. Think about when you have felt the Holy Ghost testify to
you of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon or another
gospel truth. It is important to remember that most revelation
does not come in a spectacular way. Most people will feel quiet
and subtle promptings from the Holy Ghost, such as a warm,
peaceful feeling or an assurance of the truth. The Spirit may
also testify of gospel truths line upon line, helping us learn the
truths gradually over time. Write about a time when you have
felt the confirming witness of the Holy Ghost.

Moroni 10:27-29

Moroni testified that he would meet us at the judgment
bar of God

Read Moroni 10:27-29, and consider how these
verses teach the following principle: Those who have
received the Book of Mormon will be accountable
to God for their response to it. Imagine that you
have the opportunity to meet Moroni at the judgment
bar of God. Ponder what you would say to him about
the Book of Mormon and how it has affected your life.

CL Scripture Mastery—WMoroni 10:4-5

Memorizing Moroni 10:4—5 can be of great help to you
in sharing the message of the Book of Mormon with
others. Consider taking some time now to memorize it
word for word. One way to do this is to read the passage
out loud several times. Then write it out word for word
three times on a piece of paper or in your scripture study
journal. When you have finished, see if you can recite
these verses from memory.

5. Write the following at the bottom of today’s
assignments in your scripture study journal:

Moroni 10:8—26,
30-34

Introduction

After teaching how to obtain a witness of the truth of
all things through the Holy Ghost, Moroni exhorted
those who would read his words to recognize and
receive spiritual gifts. Moroni concluded the Book of
Mormon record by exhorting all people to come unto
Jesus Christ, lay hold on every good gift He offers, and
be perfected through Him.

Moroni 10:8-26

Moroni teaches about gifts of the Spirit and their purpose
in the Lord's work

Think of a time when Heavenly Father blessed you

to be able to do something that you could not have
done on your own. In his concluding chapter, Moroni
testified of the help and strength the Lord can bestow
upon us. Read Moroni 10:8, and look for the phrase
that describes the spiritual abilities or blessings that
Heavenly Father gives to His faithful children.

The “gifts of God” Moroni spoke of in Moroni 10:8
are also referred to as “gifts of the Spirit” or “spiritual
gifts.” You may wish to mark the phrase “gifts of God”
in your scriptures. Write the following truth in your
scriptures next to Moroni 10:8: God grants gifts of
the Spirit to profit His children. The phrase “profit
His children” means to be of benefit or service to His
children.

Read Moroni 10:9-16, and mark each spiritual gift
Moroni mentioned. It is important to know that the
spiritual gifts Moroni discussed are just a few examples
of the many spiritual gifts that exist. Elder Marvin J.
Ashton of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught
that “God has given each of us one or more special
talents”:

“One of the great tragedies of life, it
seems to me, is when a person classifies
himself as someone who has no talents
or gifts... . For us to conclude that we
have no gifts when we judge ourselves by
stature, intelligence, grade-point average,

wealth, power, position, or external appearance is not
only unfair but unreasonable. .. .

“.. Taken at random, let me mention a few gifts that
are not always evident or noteworthy but that are very
important. Among these may be your gifts—gifts not
so evident but nevertheless real and valuable.

“Let us review some of these less-conspicuous

gifts: the gift of asking; the gift of listening; the gift

of hearing and using a still, small voice; the gift of
being able to weep; the gift of avoiding contention;
the gift of being agreeable; the gift of avoiding vain
repetition; the gift of seeking that which is righteous;
the gift of not passing judgment; the gift of looking to
God for guidance; the gift of being a disciple; the gift
of caring for others; the gift of being able to ponder;
the gift of offering prayer; the gift of bearing a mighty
testimony; and the gift of receiving the Holy Ghost.

“We must remember that to every man is given a gift
by the Spirit of God [see D&C 46:11-12]. It is our right
and responsibility to accept our gifts and to share them.
God's gifts and powers are available to all of us” (“There
Are Many Gifts,” Ensign, Nov. 1987, 20).

Read Moroni 10:17, and note Moroni’s teaching that
every faithful member of the Church has at least one
spiritual gift (see also D&C 46:11). Elder Robert D.
Hales of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught
that “the gifts of the Spirit .. . will help each of us
achieve our goal of eternal life.

“These gifts of the Spirit are encompassed
by the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Holy
Ghost is the third member of the eternal
Godhead and is identified as the Holy
Spirit. This Holy Spirit is a gift from God to
help us make the decisions that will allow
us to find and fulfill our mission. . . .

“Tn these latter days, an understanding of the gifts
of the Spirit has been given to us by revelation as
recorded in section 46 of the Doctrine and Covenants.
Section 46 identifies specific gifts of the Spirit as
follows:

“For all have not every gift given unto them; for there
are many gifts, and to every man is given a gift by the
Spirit of God’ (v. 11).

“We are clearly instructed that each of us is given a gift
or gifts. Do we know what gift we have been given?
Are we seeking to find our gifts?” (“Gifts of the Spirit,”
Ensign, Feb. 2002, 12).

327
1. Think about spiritual gifts you have received from
God, and then answer two or all of the following
questions in your scripture study journal:

a. How have you profited from gifts of the Spirit you have
received?

b. What examples of spiritual gifts have you seen in the
Church today?

c. How can you use your spiritual gifts to bless the lives of
others? How has your life been blessed by the gifts of others?

Consider how spiritual gifts were apparent in the
coming forth of the Book of Mormon. In the spaces
provided, identify the spiritual gifts that were noticeable
in the life of Joseph Smith, as shown in each picture:

Moroni 10:14

Moroni 10:11

Moroni 10:16

328
Moroni testified that we must have faith in order to
receive spiritual gifts. He taught that God “worketh
by power, according to the faith of the children of
men, the same today and tomorrow, and forever”
(Moroni 10:7). Read Moroni 10:19, 24, and identify
what prevents people from receiving and recognizing
spiritual gifts.

2. Write in your scripture study journal why you think
people in a condition of unbelief cannot recognize or
receive the power and gifts of God.

Read Moroni 10:20—23. Look for what Moroni taught
about the important spiritual gifts of faith, hope, and
charity. He testified that the spiritual gift of faith leads

to a wonderful blessing. Look at verse 23 to find this
blessing. Note that the word expedient means “desirable,”
and the phrase “all things which are expedient unto me”
can mean “all things that I desire you to do.” You may
want to mark the sentence in Moroni 10:23 that teaches
this principle: If we have faith, we will be able to do
what Heavenly Father wants us to do.

3. To help you recognize how this principle has been

or could be fulfilled in your life, write a few sentences
in your scripture study journal in response to one or both of
the following statements:

a. | experienced the promise in Moroni 10:23 when. . .
b. The promise found in Moroni 10:23 can help me with. . .

4. Think about the two principles you have learned in

Moroni 10:8-26: God grants gifts of the Spirit to
profit His children. If we have faith, we will be able to do
what Heavenly Father wants us to do. In your scripture study
journal, answer the following questions:

a. How can knowing these two principles help you right now
in your life?

b. How can these principles help you with opportunities that
may come in the future?

Moroni 10:30-34

Moroni concludes His record by inviting all to come unto
Christ and be perfected in Him

Do you think it is possible to be perfect
in this life? President James E. Faust

of the First Presidency explained the
commandment to become perfect:
“Perfection is an eternal goal. While we
cannot be perfect in mortality, striving for
it is a commandment, which ultimately, through the
Atonement, we can keep” (“This Is Our Day,” Ensign,
May 1999, 19).

As President Faust taught, perfection is a goal we can
work toward now and achieve in the life to come, with
the Savior’s help. Moroni concluded his testimony

by teaching what we can do to invite the Savior’s
purifying power into our lives now and ultimately
become perfected through His Atonement.

5. Make the following chart in your scripture study
journal:

What | can do What God promises

Search Moroni 10:30-33, looking for (a) what we must do to
become pure and eventually perfect and (b) what God promises
to do to help us. Record what you find in the appropriate column
of your chart.

Write the following statement underneath the chart in
your scripture study journal or in your scriptures next
to Moroni 10:32-33: As we come unto Jesus Christ,
we can be purified and perfected through His
Atonement.

Coming unto Christ is a lifelong process that begins
with believing in Him and then humbly seeking His
influence in our lives. The process continues with
accepting His gospel, accepting Him as our Savior,
repenting, covenanting with Him through gospel
ordinances, and enduring faithfully in obedience to
His commandments throughout our lives. Ultimately
we will have come unto Christ when we have become
as He is; then we can dwell with Him in the eternities.

Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles summarized Moroni’s final invitation to come
to Christ, found in Moroni 10:30-33:

“Moroni's [final testimony emphasizes]
faith in Christ, hope in Christ, the charity
of Christ, with the prayer that these
three great Christian virtues, these three
consummate Christian principles, will
lead us to purity... .

“That final, last, lonely appeal of the keystone of our
religion and the most correct book ever written is
to touch not the unclean thing; it is to be holy and
without spot; it is to be pure. And that purity can
come only through the blood of that Lamb who bore

329
our griefs and carried our sorrows, the Lamb who was
wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our
iniquities, the Lamb who was despised and afflicted,
but whom we esteemed not (see Mosiah 14)....

“Purity—through the blood of the Lamb. That is what
[the Book of Mormon] pleads for” (“A Standard unto
My People” [CES symposium on the Book of Mormon,
Aug. 9, 1994], 15, si.lds.org).

Review Moroni 10:32-33, and mark phrases
emphasizing that the only way we can be perfect is to
be perfect “in Christ.” This means that we cannot reach
perfection by ourselves; we must rely on the power
and grace of the Savior’s Atonement. Ponder why we
need the Atonement of Jesus Christ to become pure
and perfect. You may want to mark phrases in Moroni
10:32-33 that you find encouraging as you strive for
purity and the eternal goal of perfection.

Look back at what you wrote under “What I can do”
in the chart in your scripture study journal. Select one
action written there and ponder how you can be more
diligent in that area in yout life.

Read Moroni 10:34, and look for evidence of Moroni’s
faith in Jesus Christ and hope of receiving eternal life.
We too can have faith and hope as we make the study
of the Book of Mormon a lifetime pursuit and apply
the truths taught in its pages.

6. In concluding this course of study on the Book of

Mormon, answer the following questions in your scripture
study journal, and be prepared to share your answers with your
teacher:

a. What difference has studying the Book of Mormon this year
made in your life?

b. What lessons or principles have helped you “come unto
Christ” and strengthened your faith in the Savior?

c. What is your testimony of the Book of Mormon?
